Joker is a meme coin aspiring to be a leader in the TON ecosystem with a bunch of utilities. Not inspired by Pavel Durov.  
We engage the community with interesting issues that JOKER posts on Twitter.  
JOKER aims to entertain, warn about dangers in the TON blockchain, educate, and provide opportunities to earn money through delivering useful tools like:

*   Buy/Sell Bot for all swaps on stonfi - [Telegram: Contact @swaps\_ton](https://t.me/swaps_ton)
*   Buy/Sell Bot for all token swaps < $25k MC on stonfi - [Telegram: Contact @swaps\_ton](https://t.me/swaps_ton)

Hello Joker team,

Thank you for taking the time to apply for The Open League Season #1.

After a thorough review, we must inform you that, unfortunately, your product’s traction does not meet our current eligibility criteria. You can find these criteria through this [link](https://tonresear.ch/t/about-the-token-leaderboard-minor-league-category/1274).

Once the criteria are met from your side, please feel free to resubmit your application for the future seasons.

We look forward to seeing your application again in the future.

Thank you!
