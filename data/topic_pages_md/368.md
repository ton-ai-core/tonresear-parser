**Recent Updates in lolMiner:**

*   **Version 1.84:** [Download Here](https://github.com/Lolliedieb/lolMiner-releases/releases/tag/1.84)
    
    *   Improved TON/Gram mining performance by 15-18% on AMD RDNA 1-3 and NVIDIA Pascal and newer GPUs.
    *   Added EthashB3 + TON dual mining via `--dualmode TONDUAL`.
    *   Added support for mining Gram on [gramcoin.org](http://gramcoin.org) with automatic detection of the https endpoint [https://api-pool.gramcoin.org](https://api-pool.gramcoin.org/), and manual selection with `--ton-mode 5`.
    *   Fixed bugs affecting mining on Cuda 11 drivers and newer AMD drivers.
*   **Version 1.83:** [Download Here](https://github.com/Lolliedieb/lolMiner-releases/releases/tag/1.83)
    
    *   Reintroduced codes for mining TON/Gram due to popular demand. Use `-a TON` or `-a GRAM` to mine.
    *   Improved pool detection for lolminer.ton.ninja and gram.hashrate.to with `--ton-mode 6` and [https://ninja.tonlens.com](https://ninja.tonlens.com/) with `--ton-mode 4`.
    *   Added TON support for Nvidia ADA and AMD RDNA3 GPUs.
    *   Note: Nvidia Drivers 525 or higher are required. Old TON dual mining codes and solo mining mode are not available. The miner is compatible with pools using the old icemining style stratum (`--ton-mode 6`) or old https dialects. Other https connectors are not supported.

**Updating Instructions for HiveOS and RaveOS:**

*   For HiveOS, use the following commands to update to the latest version of lolMiner:
    
    ```
    wget https://github.com/Lolliedieb/lolMiner-releases/releases/download/1.84/lolMiner_v1.84_Lin64.tar.gz && tar -xvf lolMiner_v1.84_Lin64.tar.gz && pidof -x SCREEN && miner stop || echo lolminer && cp -adpR 1.84/lolMiner $(ls -d1 /hive/miners/lolminer/*/ | tail -1) && miner start
    ```
    
*   For RaveOS, open the console and execute the following commands:
    
    ```
    stop && wget https://github.com/Lolliedieb/lolMiner-releases/releases/download/1.83/lolMiner_v1.83_Lin64.tar.gz && tar -xvf lolMiner_v1.83_Lin64.tar.gz && cp -adpR 1.83/lolMiner /app-data/miners/lolminer-1.82a && start
    ```
    

This integration marks a significant milestone for the TON blockchain community, offering enhanced mining capabilities and support for the latest GPU technologies. Miners are encouraged to take advantage of these updates to optimize their mining operations and contribute to the growth of the TON ecosystem.
