_(Only for Memecoin Projects; skip if you are a Trader/Whale)_

1.  **Memecoin Name:** Sad Meow
2.  **Token Contract Address:** EQCTYw9CpKm-7iO\_VC\_7DsqkeK1Bze-u–MeZMofjQg8tEWc
3.  **Market Cap (at the time of application):** $1.3m

5.  **Number of Unique Token Holders:** 1232
6.  **Has your token been fairly launched?**
    1.  Yes
7.  **Please provide a link to your CoinGecko listing:** [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/sad-meow](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/sad-meow)
8.  **Are you applying for the Major League or Minor League?** Major
9.  **Briefly describe your memecoin’s strategy for growth and community engagement:** Since launch we’ve actively engaged the TON community on X to great success, nearly around the clock. In 10 days we’ve broken through 6000 X followers and 1400 telegram chat members. This growth has been explosive, but a moderation isn’t acceptable. Over the same time, our admin team has grown from 4 to 12 and we continue to look for qualified and professional moderators. We will continue running paid marketing/ads on [dexscreener.com](http://dexscreener.com) and Telegram, specifically targeting traders outside of TON. We will also be implementing a large contest to reward community members that are engaging the most on X. We’ve assembled a sub-group of some of our largest token holders that are willing to fund larger marketing costs, such as the coveted Golden Ticker on Dexscreener.
10.  **Do you have any partnerships with Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) or influencers?**
    1.  No - No one paid, no free tokens given. Pure community where everyone has skin in the game. This is the way.
    2.  If yes, please specify.

_(Only for Traders/Whales; skip if you are a Memecoin Project)_

Sad meow is in a league of its own, literally the first ever audio meme coin in crypto history it’s really great for TON to have something special here and the way it was launched with 1 TON and handed to the community is fantastic!! I’m so bullish ![:crying_cat_face:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/crying_cat_face.png?v=12 ":crying_cat_face:")![:musical_note:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/musical_note.png?v=12 ":musical_note:")![:gem:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/gem.png?v=12 ":gem:")![:eyes:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/eyes.png?v=12 ":eyes:")![:fire:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/fire.png?v=12 ":fire:")

Why is sad meow the best memecoin on tone? Sad Meow is the first audio token in the world, the meowing music in the token is simply mesmerizing.Sad meow is a project not of one person but of an entire community. The sad meow community is made up of unique people who helped the token grow.We went from 6k mcap to 2.5m ATH and it’s all organic growth.Strong community + first audio token = perfect memecoin. I think the sad meow is a great example of a perfect coin. And know this NFA & DYOR

The Sad Meow audio meme coin is a groundbreaking innovation, being the first of its kind in crypto history, who wouldn’t think this would be a good meme to get behind, I myself am extremely bullish for the potential this project could bring. It’s going to be ironic that it’s called Sadmeow because I’ll be giving a Happymeow once we hit 1Bil Mc. ![:crying_cat_face:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/crying_cat_face.png?v=12 ":crying_cat_face:")
