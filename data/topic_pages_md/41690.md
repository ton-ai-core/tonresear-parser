Hi,  
I made a withdrawal from Weex Exchange to LBank (USDT on TON), but I haven’t received it.  
I contacted LBank customer support, and they said the transaction couldn’t be processed because the forwarded TON amount is 0.  
After contacting both exchanges multiple times, they advised me to contact TON, as the funds are on the TON blockchain.  
What should I do?  
as it’s been a long time, and I’ve gotten no result from either exchange.  
thanks
