**Wassup, TON Founation!**

We are already 6 months old and we have recently encountered difficulties: the market maker who worked with us sold $BALLS inconsistently and collapsed the token exchange rate, because of which we have no way to pass in Memecoin Mountain according to the criteria. \*\*

**Our meme is this:**  
**\- A unique adaptation of an AI bird with eggs for TON (AI memes are hype on Solana right now and imagine the hype of the degens from there when they come with an interest in Memelandia and see BIG BALLS BIRDS);**  
**\- We are the bridge for WEB2 users to WEB3;**  
**\- Together with the community we have made 500+ memes: @bigballsmemes and we have a TikTok, videos from there have garnered a combined 150K+ views - check it out! ([https://linktr.ee/bigballsbirds](https://linktr.ee/bigballsbirds));**  
**\- Russian channel REN TV did a report about our bird ([Telegram: Contact @big\_balls\_birds](https://t.me/big_balls_birds/267));**  
**\- We have a famous NFT collection ([BIG BALLS BIRDS](https://getgems.io/collection/EQAJZy957mjfURxDg0f_8r0wLRaV02tjE6vx6NTGIlOhBVcD)) that will be used as skins in the game!**  
**\- We subscribe to the philosophy that the most important thing for a meme at TON is first and foremost meme-ness, not utility. We have a TMA coming out in early November - Flappy BIrd with the BALLSY mascot, which will attract a lot of new audiences.**

\*\*We survived a bloody summer for memcoins, we are overcoming our struggles now and we ask you to believe in us. The BIG BALLS BIRDS team will be at The TON Gateway on November 1-2 and wants to show that it is possible to be a meme even in difficult times for token capitalization. \*\*

**Stay with BIG BALLS!**

Been sitting in BALLS for a long time, been through all the circles of hell guys and still haven‚Äôt given up. I think TON Foundation should pay attention to such projects because if their token fires hard (and there is a good chance it will), it will create the FOMO with a profit that will make people from other blockchains come to TON.

The BBB is definitely worthy of being a part of the Memecoin Mountain. Please give them a chance to prove themselves. ![:two_hearts:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/two_hearts.png?v=12 ":two_hearts:")

The strongest side of this project is the community. BBB managed to gather under one wing (bird‚Äôs wing huhüê¶) people, who believe that strong memes are born from good stories. BBB went through the hardest tests, and proved that they can stand and show that even in conditions when everything seems to be going against you, there is still a chance to succeed. And everyone can reach it, but you need the BIG BALLS to make itü¶Ö

Yo, friends. I have been following the project since its very beginning, almost from the first thousand subscribers in the telegram channel. the team deserves respect, they launched the NFT collection very well, collected the presale in a few minutes. yes, the token did not enter the market very successfully. The chart is literally burning red. But despite this, they created a very cool community, introduced many people to each other, who also began to run telegram channels and promote the TON ecosystem in their messages. Despite all the difficulties, the team continues to work and hope that the memes on TON will resurrect and they will be talked about throughout the wonderful world of web3, that TON will become the new solana, and BALLS will become the new BONK‚Ä¶ And I‚Äôm doing it with them! BIG BALLS BIRDS is about community.

I‚Äôve been working on this project for quite some time now. I started my journey in cryptocurrency relatively recently, and the first project I encountered was $BALLS. Awkwardly, with absolutely no experience, I began to take a keen interest in this project. First, the presale, then various activities, NFTs, quests, game, raids. And now the project has captured my heart. Balls is not only about a close-knit community but also about strong developers who continue to work hard on the project despite all the setbacks along the way, despite other projects around them failing one after another. I believe in this project and I‚Äôm proud to be part of this community.

I ve been with this project from the very beginning. And what i liked most about it is probably the best community and developers team. I think BBB deserves to be part of Memecoin Mountain, cause it went through a lot of hard times and is still on the fly. So why not reward such a warrior with participation in Memcoin Mountain?

The most sincere developers I ever met ![:heart_hands:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/heart_hands.png?v=12 ":heart_hands:"). There was a lot of difficulties and I can‚Äôt believe this project is still alive, because the obstacles and accidents were GIANT. But they are really strong, yet seems so small. I think they have a great potential, because people, ideas and beliefs - this is that make memecoin successful. And they are ready to play long, I‚Äôm sure

It seems that BBB has been hit by a lot of adversity. Due to a series of accidents, many projects that came out around the same time have already deflated. And BBB was especially unlucky, as a result of illegal actions MM, which is terribly annoying, but surmountable.

I have been with the project from the very beginning, I was happy in moments of success and worried when things were not going well. BBB has a great team. I am surprised how they have kept the audience informed of events all this time, kept their word, explained their actions and wasted time on fools in chats.  
With such an approach, there was no option that BBB would have a weak community. I consider this one of the fundamental factors of success. In the six months of the token‚Äôs existence, a super strong community has formed around the bird with eggs, with truly sane, adequate and cool people, sincerely love them.

Initially, the Bird with Eggs was a funny meme, and now it seems to symbolize how strong in spirit you must be in sometimes really difficult times.  
I am with BBB till the end. How many events are behind that could have become fatal, but a bird with eggs will outlive many. And even if the path is difficult and thorny, it will lead to success, you only need just keep going. ![:muscle:t2:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/muscle/2.png?v=12 ":muscle:t2:")

Greetings to all!

I‚Äôm just a member of the community, not an early bird.

During this recent period, when the market in general has been very tough for altcoins and meme coins, the project BIG BALLS BIRDS has shown itself to have ‚Äúreally strong eggs.‚Äù ![:slight_smile:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12 ":slight_smile:")

Honestly, I‚Äôve seen them establish new partnerships even when everything seemed bleak. BBB kept doing their work: they held several art competitions for the community (I participated and was truly awarded multiple times!), ‚ÄúMemecity‚Äù is still going strong, and the project even launched a beta version of their game where you can play using your own skin‚Ä¶ NFT!

Promises are being kept.

I don‚Äôt wanna see a truly deserving project suffering from obstacles and the last challenge with mm that they come across ‚Äî it just isn‚Äôt fair.

I want to help this project because here, I‚Äôve found not just a strong community but friends; not just an opportunity to earn but a genuinely strong, popular meme that will ‚Äúbring the heat if it isn‚Äôt strangled.‚Äù

This could be a powerful comeback story for the entire TON ecosystem. I believe in the team, in the community, and in this project.
