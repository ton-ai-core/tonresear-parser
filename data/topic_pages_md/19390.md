Dive into the future of stable swaps with Curdle, where innovation meets efficiency. ![:fire:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/fire.png?v=12 ":fire:") ![:fire:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/fire.png?v=12 ":fire:") ![:fire:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/fire.png?v=12 ":fire:")

**Low Slippage**  
![:point_right:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/point_right.png?v=12 ":point_right:") Experience trading like never before with Curdleâ€™s minimal slippage, ensuring the ultimate trading experience.

**Capital Efficiency**  
![:point_right:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/point_right.png?v=12 ":point_right:") Curdle pools various tokens with highly concentrated liquidity, maximizing your trading efficiency.

**Low IL (Impermanent Loss)**  
![:point_right:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/point_right.png?v=12 ":point_right:") Curdle minimizes impermanent loss for liquidity providers, making it a safer and more profitable choice.

Our protocolâ€™s standout feature is the ability to pool multiple tokens with customizable weights, setting us apart from competitors like Ston Fi and Dedust. Traders benefit from incredibly low fees and ultra-low slippage, enhancing their trading experience significantly.

We are excited to gradually release our whitepaper, algorithms, architecture, **solidify** mechanism, FunC best practices, and open-source contracts. Stay tuned for our upcoming referral program and exciting events.

**Visit our testnet version and be part of the revolution:**

`Sometimes you might come across the mysterious message "TON is dead." Don't worry, it's just the TON testnet blowing up!`

Thank you ![:call_me_hand:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/call_me_hand.png?v=12 ":call_me_hand:") However, instead of saying â€˜so fire,â€™ I would suggest you say â€˜this project is so curdle.â€™ ![:laughing:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/laughing.png?v=12 ":laughing:")

Your use of emojis is spot on! Even if thereâ€™s a tsunami in terms of liquidity, Curdle Protocol can make it curdle. ![:ice_cube:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/ice_cube.png?v=12 ":ice_cube:")

Oh? You mean gas calculation? This is quite a tricky issue in TON development. Maybe we can discuss it here? Also, we will release our best practices for funC development in future topics.
