hello first of all  
I’m thinking of developing a project, but I have questions that I can’t solve.

1.  How does [fragment.com](http://fragment.com) get stars?
2.  Do we have the opportunity to get stars like [fragment.com](http://fragment.com)?  
    Even though we cannot buy it as cheaply as fragments, is there a way to get stars, even if it is expensive, through an API from Telegram?

Best regards to community.

1.  Fragment doesn’t get stars; it simply sells. This means you’re making a Web 3.0 transaction to purchase a Web 2.0 digital asset.
    
2.  There is no legal way to obtain stars directly. However, you can verify your own account on [Fragment.com](http://fragment.com/) and buy stars for your friends. Some services are now parsing Ref\_IDs from Fragment and conducting transactions from verified wallets that resemble typical user transactions on Fragment. But be cautious when doing this.
