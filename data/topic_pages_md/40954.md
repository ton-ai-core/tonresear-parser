𝐌𝐚𝐣𝐨𝐫 𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐨𝐧:

2.  Inflation: As in other African countries, a major driver of stablecoin adoption in Nigeria is inflation and the depreciation of the naira — which plummeted to a record low in February 2024. We can see the impact of this trend by looking at transfer sizes under $1 million.

In Q1 2024, stablecoin value approached almost $3billion, making stablecoins the largest portion of sub-$1M transactions in Nigeria.  
Although bitcoin and altcoins remain relevant, representing billions in value received, stablecoins is clearly the favorite medium for transactions
