> Airdrop snapshot: April 10, 09.30 am CET  
> Airdrop execution: April 11

### [](#eligibility-criteria-2)Eligibility criteria

The snapshot captures all wallets that performed swaps on Dedust and/or [Ston.fi](http://Ston.fi) between March 4 (12pm CET) and April 10 (09.30 CET) using pairs with TON or stable coins and whitelisted tokens. Sybil wallet addresses were disqualified.

Whitelisted tokens included the memecoins that were part of the [Memecoin leaderboard of The Open League](https://ton.org/en/open-league?filterBy=forProjects) at the time of the snapshot and those that ranked in the top 10 meme coins by trading volume since March 4. The whitelist hence consists of the following tokens:

*   FISH
    
*   ANON
    
*   REDO
    
*   MRDN
    
*   TONY
    
*   ARBUZ
    
*   durev
    
*   TPET
    
*   @BTC25
    
*   WIF
    
*   COFE
    
*   CATS
    
*   BOLT
    

\*This is not endorsement or investment advice. The tokens were selected based on the metrics provided by [re:doubt.](https://beta.redoubt.online/tracker)

The four eligibility criteria, which were set using the rough median value as the minimum threshold, are as follows:

*   Number of swaps > 10
*   Total trading volume ≥ $2700
*   Number of whitelisted tokens that were traded by the wallet > 2
*   Current amount of whitelisted tokens on the balance ≥ $650

With the aim of determining the size of the airdrop for each beneficiary, a points system was created. Based on the volume, the number of swaps, the number of whitelisted tokens that were traded and the current amount of whitelisted tokens on the balance, each wallet was assigned points. The sum of the points was the final score. Final scores above the median were then grouped into ranges and the size of rewards for each range of scores was determined.
