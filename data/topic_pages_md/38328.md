**Theft Wars: Shadows of TON** is a Web3 idle game built on TON blockchain. It combines idle mechanics with competitive gameplay, where players take risks and make strategic choices. But what makes Theft Wars an idle game? Let’s find out.

## [](#p-62530-what-is-an-idle-game-1)What is an Idle Game?

Idle games, also called incremental games, allow players to make progress with minimal effort. Theft Wars takes this concept and adds blockchain features. You can create a thief using Soul Bound Tokens (SBTs) and stake game tokens. Similar to other idle games, Theft Wars lets you earn rewards even when you’re not actively playing. You mint a thief and stake tokens to get stronger and earn rewards. However, other players can steal your tokens too, so you have to make careful decisions.

**Theft Wars: Shadows of TON** is more than just an idle game; it is a competitive experience where players take on the role of thieves attempting to steal tokens from others. Players begin by creating a thief as an SBT and staking game tokens.

The main part of the game is **steals**—where players attempt to take tokens from others. To succeed, targets must be chosen wisely. Your thief has skills like **expertise** (offense) and **vigilance** (defense), which determine how effective you are when attacking or defending during a steal. There’s also an element of luck (random) involved, which means even well-planned steals might not always succeed. This makes every steal is a mix of strategy and chance. Thieves can be leveled up by stealing and earning rewards, improving their abilities. Selecting the right target is crucial for success.

When you steal in Theft Wars, there is a tax applied, which helps keep the game fair and rewards active players. This tax is the one of the reasons why Theft Wars is considered an idle game—it generates passive income for players, allowing them to benefit from others activities without constant involvement. The tax is split between rewarding other players, maintaining the economy, and supporting game development.

Theft Wars has a **Cumulative Steal Progression** system, which lets you level up by stealing. There is a limit of 32 steals each day to keep things fair. The more you steal, the higher your level gets, making your thief stronger and unlocking new rewards.

Theft Wars isn’t just a game; it’s also an engaging way to learn about blockchain.

By playing Theft Wars, you can learn about blockchain, DeFi, and staking—all while having fun. It’s a great way for beginners to understand blockchain without feeling overwhelmed.
