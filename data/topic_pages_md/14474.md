The $TGR token offers a range of utilities across the Tegro ecosystem, enhancing user engagement and financial dynamics. It is actively involved in various programs:

1.  **Partnership Program**: $TGR tokens play a crucial role in our partnership programs, providing mutual benefits and incentives for collaboration.
2.  **Staking**: [Staking of $TGR](https://tegro.finance/staking) tokens takes place directly on the Tegro.Finance exchange. Lock-up periods range from 30 to 270 days, with longer periods yielding higher interest rates for token holders.
3.  **Liquidity Pools on DEX**: $TGR is an integral part of the [liquidity pools](https://tegro.finance/liquidity) on the decentralized exchange Tegro.Finance. By participating in these pools, users can facilitate trading on the platform and earn a portion of the transaction fees as rewards.
4.  **Earning Opportunities**: Users have multiple ways to earn $TGR, such as by participating in ecosystem activities or by engaging with partner projects.
5.  **Payment Method in Telegram Bot**: The $TGR token is now used as a payment method in the [Telegram bot](https://t.me/smoapp_bot?start=ref_1628878888) for a social media promotion service. Spend cryptocurrency and receive services in return.

Additionally, every transaction made using Tegro Pay now rewards users with $TGR tokens as cashback. This feature not only enhances the value of using Tegro Pay for regular transactions but also encourages the accumulation and utilization of $TGR within the ecosystem. The integration of $TGR into everyday transactions solidifies its role as a cornerstone of the Tegro platform, promoting usage and retention.
