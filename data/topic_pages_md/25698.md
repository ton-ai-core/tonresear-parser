The mission of Seeds of TON.

![:smiley:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=12 ":smiley:")Although Seed is a startup game project, some people may think that it is just another boring game and not expect too much from it.

![:grin:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/grin.png?v=12 ":grin:")But in fact, Seed is a unique social world where you can build your own social platform and contribute to the whole project.

![:star_struck:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/star_struck.png?v=12 ":star_struck:")Seed is not a boring game, but a social world where you can make more friends and build a happy home with your friends.
