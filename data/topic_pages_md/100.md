The Tonbridge project represents a pivotal advancement in blockchain interoperability, specifically facilitating the bridging between Ethereum (ETH) and TON networks. This initiative is designed to streamline the transaction process across these two platforms, enhancing efficiency and expanding possibilities within the blockchain ecosystem.

## [](#core-functionalities-and-technologies-1)Core Functionalities and Technologies

At the heart of Tonbridge are two fundamental technologies:

*   **Merkle Proof Verification**: Leveraging FunC contracts, this feature enables the verification of transactional integrity on-chain, ensuring secure and tamper-proof cross-network transactions.
*   **BLS-Signature Verifications**: Also implemented through FunC contracts, this functionality authenticates Ethereum validators’ signatures, a critical component for maintaining the reliability and trustworthiness of cross-chain operations.

These technologies are integral to the upcoming bridge project, which will include a relayer node to facilitate seamless transaction verification and validator authentication across the Ethereum and TON networks.

## [](#project-composition-2)Project Composition

### [](#key-components-3)Key Components

The project is structured into several key components, each serving a distinct role within the broader ecosystem:

*   **Contracts**: Contains the source code for all smart contracts associated with the project, along with their dependencies.
*   **Wrappers**: Provides wrapper classes that implement the `Contract` interface from ton-core, encompassing serialization/deserialization primitives and compilation functions.
*   **Tests**: A suite of tests designed to ensure the functionality and security of the contracts.
*   **Scripts**: Includes various scripts utilized by the project, predominantly focusing on deployment procedures.

### [](#usage-instructions-4)Usage Instructions

#### [](#building-and-testing-5)Building and Testing

For those interested in contributing to or deploying the Tonbridge project, the process is streamlined for ease of use:

*   **Building**: Execute `npx blueprint build` or `yarn blueprint build` to compile the contracts.
*   **Testing**: Run `npx blueprint test` or `yarn blueprint test` to verify the integrity and functionality of the contracts.
*   **Deployment**: Use `npx blueprint run` or `yarn blueprint run` for deploying contracts or running other project-related scripts.
*   **Adding New Contracts**: To expand the project’s capabilities, new contracts can be added with `npx blueprint create ContractName` or `yarn blueprint create ContractName`.

## [](#open-source-license-6)Open Source License

Tonbridge is committed to fostering an open and collaborative development environment. As such, the project is licensed under the MIT License, encouraging innovation and participation from the wider blockchain community.

In summary, Tonbridge is not just a bridge between two blockchain networks; it’s a step towards a more interconnected and efficient blockchain ecosystem. By providing robust verification mechanisms and streamlining cross-network transactions, Tonbridge aims to pave the way for a more versatile and scalable blockchain infrastructure.
