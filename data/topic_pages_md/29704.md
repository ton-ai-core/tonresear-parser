We are thrilled to introduce you to SmartLitre, a groundbreaking project designed to transform the way we stay hydrated and make a positive global impact. At SmartLitre, our mission is to make hydration fun, rewarding, and impactful for everyone.

**What is SmartLitre?**

SmartLitre is an innovative mini-app game that combines gamification with the essential habit of staying hydrated. In our app, users tap to hydrate adorable sea creatures and earn DROPS. DROPS can be collected by completing tasks, inviting friends, and staying consistent.

**Why SmartLitre?**

Across the world, many people struggle to stay hydrated due to busy schedules and demanding lifestyles. Dehydration not only affects productivity but also overall well-being. SmartLitre aims to change that by turning hydration into an engaging and rewarding experience.

**Our Greater Purpose**

We believe in a mission that goes beyond personal hydration. SmartLitre is committed to providing clean water to those in need, one country at a time. Through our platform, users can participate in initiatives that bring clean water to underserved communities around the globe.

**Countdown to Launch - 5 Days Left!**

The countdown has begun! We are just 5 days away from launching the SmartLitre mini-app game. Join us on this exciting journey to Revolutionise Hydration on DROP at a time and make a real impact.
