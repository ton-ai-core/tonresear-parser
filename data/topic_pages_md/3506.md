Hello Pi Ton Network team,

Thank you for taking the time to apply for our Open League Season 1.

After a thorough review, we must inform you that, unfortunately, your token does not meet our current eligibility criteria. You can find these criteria through this [link](https://tonresear.ch/t/about-the-memecoin-leaderboard-category/1276).

Once your token aligns with these criteria, please feel free to resubmit your application for future seasons.

We look forward to possibly seeing your application again in the future.

Thank you.
