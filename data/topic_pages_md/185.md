**Abstract**

This document introduces a protocol designed to ensure safe and verifiable signing of non-transaction data using wallet keys within the TON (The Open Network) ecosystem. The protocol, identified as Data Signatures, proposes a method for wallets to sign arbitrary data, distinguishing these signatures from transactional signatures to mitigate misuse and replay attacks.

**Introduction**

In the TON ecosystem, wallets serve dual functions: managing assets and acting as universal identifiers across applications. While the primary use case involves signing transactions for coin transfers or smart contract interactions, there exists a need for wallets to authenticate non-transactional data for off-chain and on-chain applications without compromising security.

**Proposal Summary**

*   **TEP**: [0](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/pull/0)
*   **Status**: Draft
*   **Type**: Core
*   **Authors**: Oleg Andreev, Sergey Andreev, Denis Subbotin
*   **Creation Date**: 13.12.2022
*   **Replaces**: [TEP-0](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/0000-template.md)

**Objective**

To enable the TON wallets to sign arbitrary non-transaction data securely, ensuring the signatures are distinctly separable from transaction signatures to prevent misuse.

**Methodology**

The proposal details a signature scheme for arbitrary data, incorporating a unique composition of schema identifier, timestamp, and payload hash to create domain-separated signatures.

**Implementation Details**

**Component**

**Specification**

Signing Data

352-bit message combining schema CRC, timestamp, and payload hash

Verification

Enforcing domain separation through schema CRC, payload content, and timestamp

Payload

Arbitrary data structured per TL-B definition

Security

Domain separation ensured by unique schema versions and timestamp binding

**Schema Versions**

1.  **Short plain text message**: For signing UTF-8 text, utilizing the `plaintext` schema.
2.  **Application binding**: Allows signing data specifically for target applications, identified by TON.DNS names or contract addresses.

**Security Considerations**

The proposal outlines measures for binding signatures to specific applications and timeframes to mitigate replay attacks and ensure domain separation.

**Comparison with Existing Solutions**

**Feature**

**Data Signatures Proposal**

**Ethereum EIP-1271**

Domain Separation

**Conclusion**

The Data Signatures protocol presents a comprehensive framework for securely signing non-transaction data within the TON ecosystem. By establishing a clear separation between transactional and non-transactional signatures, it offers enhanced security for both off-chain and on-chain applications, paving the way for a more versatile and secure digital identity and authentication system within the TON network.

This proposal is an evolution of @ex3ndr's \[safe-signing proposal\](https://githu[‚Ä¶](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/pull/104)b.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/pull/93). Highlights: \* "Invalid cell representation" trick is not necessary because we are signing a differently-sized message. \* Separate schemas for plaintext messages and binary messages. User can explicitly check all the data they are signing. \* Mandatory binding to a timestamp. \* Support for binding to smart contract address and domain name. \* Possibility for future extensions with detailed schemas retaining backwards compatibility with the wallets. Rendered specification: \* \[üìÑ TEP: Data Signatures\](https://github.com/oleganza/TEPs/blob/datasig/text/0000-data-signatures.md)
