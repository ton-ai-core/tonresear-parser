Hello team,

Thank you for taking the time to apply for The Open League Season #1.

After a thorough review, we must inform you that, unfortunately, your token does not meet our current eligibility criteria. You can find them through this link \[[About the Memecoin Leaderboard category](https://tonresear.ch/t/about-the-memecoin-leaderboard-category/1276)\].

Once your token aligns with these criteria, please feel free to resubmit your application for the future seasons.

We look forward to seeing your application again in the future.

Thank you.
