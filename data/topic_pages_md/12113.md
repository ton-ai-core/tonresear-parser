It‚Äôs just a game! A game full of social experiments with highly-trustless Reward Mechanism powered by ZK.

$VIRUS will be minted and sent to top-rated users of each pandemic.

$VIRUS will be deeply integrated and used in the game logic.

## [](#please-describe-your-project-roadmap-for-the-next-6-12-months-3)Please describe your project roadmap for the next 6-12 months

@epidemy will be the second ZK project on TON that will use the result of R&D of the other well-known hated ZK protocol on TONüåö

ZK will be used as a verification layer for the game logic so for the first time on TON we have verifiable game logic implemented.

Will we fail to build a true Web3 competitive game? Only time can tell, but I‚Äôm already tired of waiting for someone to do it so I decided to do it myself.

A game for the smart - here you can come up with your own strategies and compete with other players in tactical skills. Innovative and interesting.
