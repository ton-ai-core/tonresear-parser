    We are aiming to build a transparent and verifiable system to track users impact. Therefore, we need your help to track all user interactions with your protocol. Final calculations will be implemented on top of the [TON Data Lake](https://github.com/re-doubt/ton-etl) project and all the data sets for your project will be available for all analytical projects like Dune, Nansen, etc.
    
    To make it possible, we need to have full implementation details related to your protocol, including **the overall architecture design and exact TL-B schemas,** as well as get the method’s signatures for all your contracts.
