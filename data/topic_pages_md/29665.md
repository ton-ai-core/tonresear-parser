Dear community members!

SeedsofTON has completed its closed beta testing phase, and we are currently working on resolving some performance issues that arose during the testing process, including floating text effects, user interface (UI) display errors, and other minor issues.

Once these issues are resolved, we will officially launch the product.

Please continue to follow our channels and community announcements for the latest information on the release date.
