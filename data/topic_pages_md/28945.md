## [](#gmcoin-concept-summary-9)GMCoin Concept Summary

GMCoin is inspired by the concept of earning rewards through self-discipline with the aim of promoting good health habits. Users can participate in self-discipline activities by sleeping, waking up, and eating on time, and they receive rewards for their consistency. If a user misses a check-in, they can revive using TON energy. GMCoin creates a health-focused, self-disciplined community where maintaining discipline leads to wealth.

### [](#welcome-to-gmcoin-11)Welcome to GMCoin

With the development of technology, people have more entertainment options in their daily lives. However, excessive entertainment can negatively affect habits. GMCoin is a Web3 application designed to improve this situation. Our vision is to help participants develop good habits—such as going to bed early and eating on time—while providing real rewards.

### [](#challenge-structure-12)Challenge Structure

Each day, GMCoin holds a round of challenges that last for 8 days:

*   **Day 1**: Signup phase (no check-ins required)
*   **Days 2-8**: Challenge phase (5 check-ins per day)

### [](#daily-check-ins-13)Daily Check-ins

Each day’s challenge consists of 5 check-ins:

*   **GM**: From UTC 07:00 to 07:30
*   **Breakfast**: From UTC 08:30 to 09:00
*   **Lunch**: From UTC 12:00 to 12:30
*   **Dinner**: From UTC 18:00 to 18:30
*   **GN**: From UTC 21:00 to 21:30

Players participate in the challenge by spending $GMC. Each check-in adds an additional 3% of the entry fee to the prize pool, increasing the rewards for a successful challenge.

### [](#participation-and-rewards-14)Participation and Rewards

*   After signing up, players enter a one-day signup phase.
*   During the challenge phase, players must complete five daily check-ins to succeed and move to the next day’s challenge.
*   After successfully completing a 7-day challenge, rewards are based on the $GMC consumed during signup. The more $GMC consumed, the greater the rewards.
*   Missing a check-in requires expending POWER to make up for it. Failure to complete a check-in results in losing the challenge and forfeiting the accumulated $GMC.

### [](#points-and-rankings-15)Points and Rankings

*   Players have 30 minutes to check-in and earn POINTS.
*   A maximum of 1,800 POINTS can be earned per check-in, with 1 POINT lost for each second of delay.
*   Players are ranked by total POINTS earned, with additional $GMC prizes for the top three players:
    *   **1st place**: 1% of the prize pool (up to 1,000,000 $GMC)
    *   **2nd place**: 0.5% of the prize pool (up to 500,000 $GMC)
    *   **3rd place**: 0.01% of the prize pool (up to 100,000 $GMC)
