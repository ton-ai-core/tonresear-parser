    To make it possible, we need to have full implementation details related to your protocol, including **the overall architecture design and exact TL-B schemas,** as well as get the method’s signatures for all your contracts.

Hello team,

It seems the app is not functioning properly at link [Telegram: Contact @BeetrootFiBot](https://t.me/BeetrootFiBot?startapp), which prevents us from testing it. Unfortunately, due to this issue, we are unable to accept your application for The Open League Season 7.
