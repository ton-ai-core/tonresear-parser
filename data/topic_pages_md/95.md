**Introduction**

Exciting news for developers and enthusiasts in zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain technology! The `snarkjs` tool, a cornerstone project from `iden3`, now boasts a groundbreaking update - the introduction of verifier generation in FunC language, tailored for the TVM Challenge. This integration not only enriches `snarkjs` but also marks a significant leap in cryptographic tooling.

**What is snarkjs?**

For the uninitiated, `snarkjs` is a comprehensive JavaScript and Web Assembly implementation of zkSNARK and PLONK schemes. It’s designed to simplify the process of generating zero-knowledge proofs, particularly for `circom 2.0` circuits. With this tool, users can engage in secure multi-party ceremonies like the [_powers of tau_](https://medium.com/coinmonks/announcing-the-perpetual-powers-of-tau-ceremony-to-benefit-all-zk-snark-projects-c3da86af8377) and circuit-specific ceremonies, essential for maintaining integrity in cryptographic computations.

**New Features in the TVM Challenge Update**

The latest update shines in its support for **BLS12-381** curve operations and **Keccak256** hash, key components in advanced cryptographic functions. Notably, this update allows exporting verifiers in FunC, a feature pivotal for developers working with the TVM blockchain.

To get started, simply clone the fork, install dependencies using `npm ci`, and follow the standard `snarkjs` guide. The process culminates in exporting a verifier in FunC using `node cli.js zkey export funcverifier circuit_final.zkey verifier.fc`.

**Deep Dive into snarkjs**

Beyond the TVM Challenge, `snarkjs` offers an array of functionalities:

*   **Universal Multi-party Ceremonies**: Supports both bn128 and bls12-381 curves, catering to a wide range of cryptographic needs.
*   **Compatibility**: Interoperable with Semaphore’s Perpetual Powers of Tau and other implementations, ensuring wide-ranging utility.
*   **Node.js and Browser Support**: Flexible usage in different environments, whether you’re scripting in Node.js or deploying directly in a browser.
*   **Performance**: Leveraging Web Assembly and parallel computations, it stands out for its high performance.

* * *

**Getting Started**

Beginners can easily dive into `snarkjs`:

1.  **Installation**: Ensure Node.js (v16 or later) is installed. Then, install `snarkjs` with `npm install -g snarkjs@latest`.
2.  **Basic Usage**: Explore commands and their functions using `snarkjs --help`.
3.  **Advanced Features**: For those delving deeper, the tool offers extensive capabilities from setting up ceremonies to generating proofs and verifiers.

**In Conclusion**

This update to `snarkjs` not only caters to the specific needs of the TVM Challenge but also significantly enhances the toolkit available to developers in the realm of zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain technology. It’s a testament to the evolving landscape of cryptographic tools, making complex processes more accessible and efficient.
