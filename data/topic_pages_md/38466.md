Imagine that each of your NFT is not just a beautiful digital asset, but a real chance to win by predicting the bitcoin exchange rate! Yes, you heard right. **BetmanNFT** is a unique collection of stickers based on the TON blockchain, which allow you not only to collect, but also to participate in monthly sweepstakes.

**How does it work?**

• Each NFT has attributes: the day and the price of bitcoin.  
• Every month, your sticker becomes a bet on the minimum or maximum value of bitcoin.  
• If your prediction worked, you share the prize pool with other winners!

**What makes BetmanNFT special?**

It’s not just a collection — it’s a game where everyone can try their luck and win based on their predictions. **BetmanNFT** is your ticket to an exciting world where art meets financial opportunities.  
Are you ready to try it? Hurry up to purchase your **BetmanNFT** and immerse yourself in the game where bets really matter!
