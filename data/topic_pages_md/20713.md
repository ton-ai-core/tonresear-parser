Hello team,

Thank you for taking the time to apply for The Open League.

After a thorough review, we must inform you that, unfortunately, your project does not meet our current eligibility criteria. You can find the detailed criteria through this link: [About the DeFi Battle category - #2 by Mukhammad\_Sajidin](https://tonresear.ch/t/about-the-defi-battle-category/20071/2)

Once the criteria are met from your side, please feel free to resubmit your application for future seasons. We look forward to seeing your application again in the future.

Thank you!
