We have created a ready-to-use solution for jetton projects that want to use airdrop as a marketing tool to promote their token on the TON network.  
This is when a project launches a new Jetton token and wants to start an airdrop for those who subscribe to the projectâ€™s chats and groups in Telegram.  
Even after the token generation event, it will be possible to distribute the token to airdrop recipients via our solution. On-chain claim Jetton tokens of the project will be available to them.  
If you have any questions about the project, please contact support - we will be happy to help you promptly.
