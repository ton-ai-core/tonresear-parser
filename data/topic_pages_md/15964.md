Upcoming Plans:

1.  Open Wallet Binding Feature:  
    Currently, we primarily encourage users to use Telegram Wallet for payments. Moving forward, we will encourage users to bind their wallets for enhanced wallet interactions.
2.  Support for More Jetton Tokens:  
    We plan to expand our support to include more Jetton tokens, collaborating with additional project partners.
3.  Expand On-Chain Interaction Play:  
    We will introduce on-chain contract interactions such as check-ins and registrations, aiming to increase the number of on-chain transactions.
