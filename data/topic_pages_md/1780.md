Users have the opportunity to deposit liquidity into the TON/OPEN trading pair on the DEX swap platform and receive bonuses for augmenting liquidity on [dedust.io](http://dedust.io). Furthermore, we are on the brink of introducing the capability to deposit liquidity into the pool on our OpenExchange (MVP already launched).

The Open Project will tie Blockchains together with unique ecosystem with digital goods marketplace.

I think that TON and Open goals are similar: make cryptocurrencies popular among people, bring business to TON blockchain, tie different blockchains with power of The Open Network.

Most of businesses on TON are gambling and scammy jettons, but The Open Project is making marketplace for real products, that people really use and trade outside of crypto world.

So, if TON want to develop ecosystem with business that has real economics, it must support The Open Project.
