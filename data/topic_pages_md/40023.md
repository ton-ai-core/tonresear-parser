    *   Project Description: Delea is an innovative multi collateral yield bearing protocol ($TON, tsTON, stTON, tgBTC, etc.), offering flexibility and expanded asset support. At the core of the protocol are two key tokens:  
        D-One Token ($DONE) - the over-collateralized stablecoin backed by other cryptocurrencies. It is designed to maintain a stable value of approximately 1 USD, offering users a reliable medium of exchange and store of value.  
        LEA Token ($LEA) - the governance token of Delea is used among the protocol, empowering token holders with voting rights on key protocol decisions, and providing additional protocol profit to LEA holders.
