The game result algorithm is open source. Please [click here](https://jsfiddle.net/toncrash/apquf4gc/embedded/result/) for more information.

We finalized our mini-app today, just in time for the application. In the coming weeks, we plan to launch a comprehensive marketing campaign, partnering with various projects on the TON blockchain.

While we don’t have metrics yet, Crash is a well-established game in other ecosystems like Bitcoin and Solana. For reference, please see [bustabit.com](https://bustabit.com) and [solanacrash.io](https://solanacrash.io).

Conservatively, we estimate reaching 1,000 Daily Active Users (DAU), 10,000 monthly transactions with retention rates of 30% on Day 1 (D1), 23% on Day 7 (D7), and 15% on Day 14 (D14) by the end of July.

Name indicated in the bot for SDK integration: `TONCrash`
