At Sentism, we believe that meaningful AI doesn’t start in a lab — it starts with people. With everyday choices, micro-interactions, and collective momentum.

That’s why we built the Sentism Mini App: a lightweight, reward-driven space where anyone can engage with AI, one Z Point at a time.

Whether exploring the ecosystem, inviting your network, or launching your first Agent, each action you take contributes to a more intelligent, more social AI layer.

The Sentism Mini App is your entry point to the Sentism Layer — a social coordination layer for AI.

It’s designed for participation. From checking in daily to launching your own AI Agent, the Mini App enables you to:

*   ![:cyclone:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/cyclone.png?v=12 ":cyclone:") **Check in every day** to earn 10Z and build your engagement streak
*   ![:brain:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/brain.png?v=12 ":brain:") **Complete simple tasks** that deepen your connection to the ecosystem
*   ![:handshake:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/handshake.png?v=12 ":handshake:") **Invite friends** and grow a network of aligned contributors
*   ![:gear:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/gear.png?v=12 ":gear:") **Trade Z Points or deploy an Agent** right from within the app

Each action feels small, but collectively, it unlocks something far bigger — a network of people and machines evolving together.

## [](#p-68035-why-z-points-matter-3)Why Z Points Matter

Z Points aren’t just points — they’re your early contribution to a value layer in motion. Today, they represent your participation. But tomorrow?

Z Points will evolve into tokens, perks, and deeper levels of utility.  
They will power access, identity, and opportunity across the Sentism Layer.

Think of Z Points as proof-of-engagement — a lightweight, permissionless way to start building reputation and rewards inside a growing AI-native economy.

## [](#p-68035-participation-is-the-new-intelligence-4)Participation is the New Intelligence

You don’t need to write code. You don’t need to understand neural networks.  
All you need to do is show up.

The Sentism Mini App makes it simple to engage, earn, and learn — turning daily micro-interactions into long-term alignment with the future of AI.

This is how decentralized AI coordination begins:  
Not with complexity, but with participation.

## [](#p-68035-ready-to-start-5)Ready to Start?

The Mini App is live. The missions are active. The Z is waiting.
