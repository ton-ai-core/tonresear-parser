**1\. Understanding the Concept**

**What is the Universal Basic Smartphone (UBS)?**  
The Universal Basic Smartphone (UBS) is pioneering an inclusive digital economy by ensuring fair compensation for personal data. In the age of artificial intelligence, businesses profit significantly from the use of personal data without explicit consent. UBS advocates for a future where everyone receives their fair share by enabling individuals to reclaim ownership of their data. As a proponent of a paradigm where participation is rewarded, UBS is committed to a digital ecosystem that prioritizes reciprocity.

**How does Oyster Labs envision the UBS to function and its role in providing digital access to underserved populations?**  
Oyster Labs envisions the Universal Basic Smartphone (UBS) as a gateway to a more equitable digital landscape, offering users not just a device, but a path to empowerment and financial inclusion. When you purchase a UBS, you’re not just getting a phone – you’re entering a world where your data has value and you have control.

**2\. Ton Blockchain Integration**

**What is the Ton blockchain and its features that make it suitable for the UBS project?**  
The Open Network (TON) is a decentralized platform developed by the team behind the messaging app Telegram. It’s designed to be a scalable and efficient blockchain infrastructure that supports a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps) and services.

One of the key features that make TON suitable for the UBS project is its scalability. TON uses a unique mechanism called the “Infinite Sharding Paradigm” to achieve high throughput and scalability. This allows the network to process a large number of transactions per second, making it capable of handling the demands of a smartphone ecosystem where millions of users may be interacting simultaneously.

Another important feature of TON is its support for smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. These contracts enable automated and trustless interactions between parties, which can be particularly beneficial for the UBS project. Smart contracts can be used to automate processes such as data monetization, rewards distribution, and decentralized application management on the UBS platform.

Additionally, TON has built-in support for decentralized storage and micropayments. This means that users of the UBS can securely store their data on the blockchain and easily monetize it through micropayments, all without relying on centralized intermediaries. This aligns well with the goals of the UBS project, which aims to empower users to control and monetize their data.

**How does UBS leverage the Ton blockchain for its operations, such as identity verification, secure transactions, and data storage?**  
UBS taps into the potential of the TON blockchain, facilitated by its integration with Telegram, one of the world’s largest social networking platforms. With a vast user base, Telegram offers a solid foundation for projects seeking widespread adoption of their technology. The TON blockchain, when seamlessly integrated within the UBS, will enable secure transactions, promising a frictionless experience for users. However, while the current focus lies on transactional efficiency, the specifics of utilizing the TON blockchain for identity verification and data storage remain unclear due to a lack of technical documentation. Moving forward, clarity on how UBS will harness the capabilities of the TON blockchain in these critical areas will be essential for its evolution and efficacy.
