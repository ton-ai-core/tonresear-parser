Iâ€™ve been on this project since firelaunch. Very attracted by the stable token price, calm, friendly and structured community. The founder has a lot of ideas for the development of the project, which are being systematically implemented. There is a DAO chat where the founder publishes his ideas for the community to discuss. Recently, a game based on the Saudi quest of oil extraction has been launched. In my opinion, the project has a great future, shaped by the joint efforts of the founder and the community ![:heart:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/heart.png?v=12 ":heart:") ![:heart:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/heart.png?v=12 ":heart:") ![:heart:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/heart.png?v=12 ":heart:")

Hello team,

Thank you for taking the time to apply for The Open League.

After a thorough review, we must inform you that, unfortunately, your NFT collection does not meet our current eligibility criteria. You can find these criteria through this link [About the NFT Battle category](https://tonresear.ch/t/about-the-nft-battle-category/20070)

Once the criteria are met from your side, please feel free to resubmit your application for the future seasons.

We look forward to seeing your application again in the future.

Thank you!
