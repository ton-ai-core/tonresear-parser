### [](#conclusion-5)Conclusion

Choosing the right method to access TON Sites depends on a userâ€™s priorities, technical expertise, and the intended use case. For casual browsing, ton.run offers the quickest but least secure access. Browser extensions such as MyTonWallet and TON Wallet strike a balance between ease of use and privacy. Meanwhile, connecting through a public proxy or using Tonutils-Proxy caters to users prioritizing security and reliability over convenience. As the TON ecosystem continues to evolve, these methods may see enhancements in usability and security, further expanding the accessibility of TON Sites to a broader audience.
