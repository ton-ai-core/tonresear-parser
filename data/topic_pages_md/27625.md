*   Token Name: UTYA
    
*   Project’s Twitter: [@TonUtyacoin](https://twitter.com/TonUtyacoin)
    
*   Please describe your project and token utility: UTYA is a memecoin based on the popular Telegram sticker pack “UTYA the duck”. This duck sticker pack is extremely popular amongst Telegram users and has also gone viral in 2024 on other platforms such as X and Twitch. A full history can be found on this [knowyourmeme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/telegram-duck-gifs) website
    
*   Please provide detailed information on your token distribution, especially indicating the % of token supply held by the team and the status of the team’s LP tokens: UTYA is a community takeover project with burnt liquidity almost completely on [Ston.fi](http://Ston.fi). The team do not control a significant % of supply of the token. The vast majority is owned by the community.
    
*   Please describe your project roadmap for the next 6-12 months: Whilst primarily a memecoin, UTYA has a main aim of promoting TON and bringing new users from other blockchains into the TON ecosystem. Given the huge use of Telegram and the prominence of UTYA on Telegram’s promotional material, we hope to use this recognition to attract new entrants to TON. We also intend to release art and videos commemorating UTYA and TON.
