Hey folks! Happy to present the [**Foton**](https://foton.sh/) library for creating TON dApps with ease! ![:zap:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/zap.png?v=12 ":zap:")

No need for mixing up tonweb, toncore, tonconnect and tonapi. No need for wondering what are cells and slices. Just use Foton and do what you need.

The library currently supports:

![:white_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:") Wallet connection

![:white_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:") Sending transactions

![:white_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:") Querying the blockchain

![:white_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:") Deploying and interacting with smart contracts

![:white_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:") Blueprint and TON Connect integration for easy code migrations

![:white_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:") Type safe interfaces with full auto-completion for contract methods and returns

You can start with Foton by building a [simple Counter dApp in React](https://foton.sh/docs/guides/tutorial). This tutorial will help you set up the environment, connect to a wallet and work with the counter smart contract.

![:rocket:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/rocket.png?v=12 ":rocket:") This is the first release of Foton, so expect that features might not work as expected. If you encounter any problem, please report it to [GitHub issues](https://github.com/VanishMax/foton/issues) or to the [Telegram chat](https://t.me/fotonjs).
