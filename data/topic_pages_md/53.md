The TON Virtual Machine (TVM) has recently undergone its most significant update, introducing extended cryptography, arbitrary-precision arithmetic, and new instructions. This enhancement positions TVM as one of the most versatile virtual machines in the blockchain sphere. Letâ€™s delve into the specifics of this update and its implications for the development of smart contracts, services, and products on TON.

1.  How does the integration of a wide range of cryptographic methods, including SHA256, SHA512, BLAKE2B, KECCAK256, KECCAK512, and various cryptographic primitives on curves like secp256k1, secp256r1, Ristretto, and BLS12-381, impact the versatility and security of TVM?
2.  Considering the new support for arbitrary-precision arithmetic operators, what are the potential applications and benefits for developers working on complex financial and mathematical smart contracts?
3.  The addition of new instructions aims to simplify smart contract creation on TON. Can you provide examples or case studies demonstrating how these instructions streamline the development process and enhance security?
4.  With the unique feature of safely running TVM inside TVM, what are the implications for testing, deployment, and scalability of smart contracts on the TON platform?
5.  Finally, how do these updates position TVM in comparison to other virtual machines used in popular blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin, especially in terms of attracting hardware wallet and device manufacturers for wider adoption?

This comprehensive discussion aims to explore the technical and practical aspects of the recent TVM update, encouraging contributions and insights from experts in the field of blockchain technology and cryptography.
