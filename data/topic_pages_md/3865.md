Hello SHIBATON team,

Thank you for applying to The Open League Season #1.

After reviewing your application, we must inform you that your token does not meet our current eligibility criteria. Concerns regarding suspicious trading activity by the team have also been noted. For more information on our criteria, please visit this [page](https://tonresear.ch/t/about-the-memecoin-leaderboard-category/1276).

Once these issues are resolved, you are welcome to reapply for future seasons.

Thank you.
