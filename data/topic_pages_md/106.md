In the rapidly evolving landscape of blockchain technology, the TON (Telegram Open Network) Blockchain stands out for its unique approach to wallet infrastructure. Unlike other blockchains like Ethereum or Solana, which typically have a uniform wallet structure, TON introduces a diverse ecosystem of wallet contracts, each version tailored to specific functionalities and use cases. This article delves into the various versions and modifications of TON wallet contracts, offering a comprehensive comparison to understand their differences and applications.

## [](#understanding-wallet-contract-variations-1)Understanding Wallet Contract Variations

At the heart of TON’s innovative wallet system is the concept that each wallet is essentially a smart contract. This paradigm allows for a high degree of customization and functionality, paving the way for multiple wallet versions, each with its set of features. Below, we compare the primary wallet versions developed on the TON Blockchain to highlight their key differences and use cases.

Type

Functionality

Use Case

High-load wallet

Up to 254 transactions per smart contract call, different approach to prevent replay attacks

Crypto exchanges, high-volume transactions

Lockup wallet

Lock coins until a specified time, with customizable unlock periods

Vesting schedules, time-locked funds

Restricted wallet

Transfers allowed to only one pre-defined destination address, excluding validation contracts

Controlled spending, validator operation with restricted funds

## [](#highlighted-features-and-considerations-4)Highlighted Features and Considerations

*   **Seqno Retrieval**: The ability to retrieve the sequence number (seqno) and public key from the contract is crucial for managing transactions and ensuring the security of operations. V1 lacks this feature, which is subsequently added in revisions and newer versions.
*   **`valid_until` Parameter**: Introduced in Wallet V2, this parameter allows users to set a time limit on transactions, adding an extra layer of control and security.
*   **`subwallet_id`**: Available from Wallet V3 onwards, this feature enables the creation of multiple wallets under the same public key, simplifying wallet management for users.
*   **Plugins**: A distinctive feature of Wallet V4, plugins allow for the integration of complex logic with the wallet’s operations, opening up possibilities for automated transactions and enhanced interaction with DApps.

## [](#conclusion-5)Conclusion

The TON Blockchain’s approach to wallet contracts represents a significant advancement in the flexibility and functionality available to users. From the basic Wallet V1 to the feature-rich Wallet V4, each version caters to different needs, ranging from simple transactions to advanced use cases requiring automated logic. Moreover, special wallets like high-load, lockup, and restricted wallets offer tailored solutions for specific scenarios, further demonstrating the versatility of TON’s wallet contract ecosystem. Understanding these variations enables users and developers to select the most appropriate wallet version for their requirements, ensuring optimal performance and security on the TON Blockchain.
