## [](#p-64818-tonxjs-sdk-effortless-development-for-the-ton-blockchain-3)TONX.js SDK: Effortless Development for the TON Blockchain

The new TONX.js SDK makes onboarding to the TON blockchain seamless, empowering you to leverage the strength of TONX API to launch your Dapp quickly. Even if you’re new to the TON ecosystem, TONX.js simplifies your journey, helping you get started with ease.

## [](#p-64818-tonxjs-adapter-simplified-migration-from-other-ton-sdkston-apis-4)TONX.js Adapter: Simplified Migration from Other TON SDKs/TON APIs

The new TONX.js Adapter allows for an easy transition from popular TON client libraries like [@ton/ton](https://github.com/ton-org/ton), [TonWeb](https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb), and [TonClient4](https://github.com/ton-org/ton/blob/master/src/client/TonClient4.ts). Just a few code changes and you’re ready to go.

Already using existing TON APIs like TON Center? Migrate effortlessly with our SDK.

## [](#p-64818-boc-parsing-tool-6)BoC Parsing Tool

Bag of Cells (BoC) is a format for serializing cells into byte arrays. On TON, everything consists of cells, including contract code, stored data, blocks, achieving streamline and robust flexibility in the process.

Our **BoC Parsing Tool** allows developers to easily decode and interpret BoC data. With a TONX API key, you can check BOC on the mainnet or testnet, initiate a request, and instantly view the response to confirm if your BoC is ready to go.

## [](#p-64818-estimate-fee-api-7)Estimate Fee API

In smart contract development and testing, a common challenge is the gap between estimated transaction fees and the actual fees upon execution. This discrepancy often creates an unwanted margin of error.

To address this, our **EstimateFee API** is here. By reflecting real-time conditions, it ensures that the fee shown before broadcasting closely aligns with the final fee charged.

Unlike other tools that estimate fees by statically checking transaction size and other invariable parameters, our API simulate the process of running transactions in the virtual TON blockchain with high fidelity as the real mainnet. This allows us to estimate fee that’s far more accurate and reliable.
