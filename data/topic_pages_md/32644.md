**Chocolate Coin** ![:chocolate_bar:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/chocolate_bar.png?v=12 ":chocolate_bar:")![:gem:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/gem.png?v=12 ":gem:")![:cake:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/cake.png?v=12 ":cake:")

Chocolate Coin is primarily a congratulatory token.

Utility and main essence - to bring benefit in the form of congratulations.

**Spiritual component - ‚Äúthank you‚Äù, ‚ÄúI thank you‚Äù, ‚Äúcongratulate‚Äù**.

> We are talking about a socially useful token ![:recycle:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/recycle.png?v=12 ":recycle:") with 2 types of utility‚Ä¶ and 3 types of monetization

.

The advantages are a relatively easy launch and, in theory, mass adoption + monetization within the application.

**At least every person faces such a situation 2 times a year. On average, from 15 to 60 times with situations where it is useful per year**.

Wrapped in an idea/method - ‚Äú**to give chocolate**‚Äù.

In the real world, this is used through: ‚Äúto give a chocolate bar ![:chocolate_bar:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/chocolate_bar.png?v=12 ":chocolate_bar:")/a box of chocolates‚Äù or ‚Äúto congratulate with a cake ![:birthday:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/birthday.png?v=12 ":birthday:")![:cake:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/cake.png?v=12 ":cake:")/champagne‚Äã:champagne:‚Äù

Here the idea is the same, to replace the real tradition with congratulations with crypto.

A token through which you can express gratitude to other people.

To thank for the work done, the service rendered, the assistance provided.

Congratulate on a birthday, graduation, the end of an event, successful completion or receipt of something (documents, exam), promotion or your own way to say thank you to a person, friend, relative, acquaintance.

The additional essence of the idea is ‚Äúhold the chocolate‚Äù.

After all, the simplest way to materially congratulate a person in the physical world is to give him a chocolate bar.

My idea is a gratitude token - Chocolate. ![:chocolate_bar:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/chocolate_bar.png?v=12 ":chocolate_bar:")

In other words, you can give a gift / thank a person through it.

It will be quite applicable to send this cryptocurrency to someone through the \*send function in the general chat.

Imagine a general chat of colleagues and one of the employees has a holiday (birthday, gave birth to a child, got a license, passed an exam, received a diploma).

The token will have an application. A person logs in and sees.

A chart of chocolate bars by country. Conventionally, EU countries (Germany, France), the CIS, and Japan, for example.

That is, he sees three columns of different colors and prices in USD and CHOCOLATE next to them.

He can also choose to be shown the average price in a certain country

Or even better, the average price of a box of chocolates or a cake.

Inspiration from the McMenu Index (when you can easily determine the level of a country‚Äôs economy by going to a Mac and ordering ![:fries:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/fries.png?v=12 ":fries:")![:hamburger:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/hamburger.png?v=12 ":hamburger:")). Here‚Äôs a similar index you can make for chocolate. This is the ‚Äúcool‚Äù component of the token (marketing).

The application will also have beautiful congratulatory pictures for downloading.

**Monetization** - through the sale of the token itself, a 3% swap tax (like clowns through a smart contract) for team development.

_And a special section and sale of discount/service vouchers from partners_. **Let‚Äôs say tours from tour operators or (I know you said it on AMA, we used to own a STO) sale of a discount (voucher) for diagnostics at a partner STO (this is for example, in fact, there could be IT courses, foreign language courses).**

That is, the real applicability and development of the project will consist of collaborations with projects and sales through the CHOCOLATE bot of their services or goods.

For monetization, you can release an NFE collection, where there will be discounts on partner services. Like a promo code or discount card for the purchase of conditional advertising in the partner‚Äôs channel (conditionally 15% on an advertising post) and other activities, bonuses and privileges.

In other words, marketing and marketplace.
