MemeStore is a meme launch platform on the Ton Blockchain, where everyone can launch their own memecoins in a simple and secure way. Currently, we have built two launching methods—Direct Launch and Fair Launch—allowing you to issue a memetoken for 0.52 and 0.45 TON respectively.

**How does it work?**

Memecoins are created using either Direct Launch or Fair Launch modes. In Direct Launch, early participants can buy memecoins at a reasonable price and achieve substantial returns due to the bonding curve mechanism. Once enough holders possess a token and the market value reaches 8796 TON, all liquidity will be deposited into [Ston.fi](http://Ston.fi) and the LP tokens will be burned to ensure permanent liquidity.

According to the bonding curve pricing mechanism provided by MemeStore, early buyers will see a significant price increase in meme coins with a relatively small investment amount.

MemeStore’s Fair Launch mode, inspired by the BRC-20 and Runes rules, ensures fairness and transparency, providing all participants with an equal opportunity to obtain tokens.

Your memecoin is immediately tradable after launching.

**Innovative Invitation Mechanics**

We have also implemented an in-app invitation system to incentivize users to grow organically. We believe that with Telegram’s large user base, this product has the potential to grow significantly within the ecosystem.

Users can earn task and trading points by completing daily tasks and inviting others to trade on MemeStore. Points are the only way to receive airdrops, with task points accounting for 30% and trading points accounting for 70% of the weight.
