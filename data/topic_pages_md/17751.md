Scam NFTs on the TON blockchain has recently become mainstream.

Every day we can see hundreds of people’s messages receiving them and don’t know what to do next, or do it incorrectly.

In this article we will look at correct methods of interacting with scam NFTs.

**Brief overview:** we will use functions of the wallet itself to visually hide NFT or send it to the zero “burn” address (highly not recommended): `UQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJKZ`

For example I took most popular non-custodial wallets: [Tonkeeper](https://tonkeeper.com/) and [MyTonWallet](https://mytonwallet.io/).

### [](#tonkeeper-2)Tonkeeper

The most common suboptimal action made by users of this wallet is sending scam NFTs to a zero “burn” address.

**You don’t have to do this**, nor do you have to **pay network fees** for send transaction. In any case, scam NFT will sooner or later completely disappear from all wallets that hold it.

For you, this wallet has built-in functionality, you can literally **visually hide** any NFTs from your wallet in few taps.

* * *

As you see, I have scam NFT in my collectibles.

I go to main Wallet page, then click **Settings** button.

[![tonkeeper - step 2](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/624755a830e322a60638898b0a7a44983a17f586_2_232x500.png)

* * *

In Settings we need to choose **Tokens**.

[![tonkeeper- step 3](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/1/14509474da83fc2e7a467599ae80b4645f5a27ed_2_232x500.png)

* * *

In Tokens page we go to **Collectibles category**.

Here you will see all you NFTs.

We need to tap on “hide” icon near item to make it hidden.

You can hide unnecessary or scam tokens from your wallet here too.

[![tonkeeper - step 4](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/bcbe98662d99129dae740df7e4aaeefed26e3057_2_232x500.png)

* * *

Now scam NFT is in **Hidden** subcategory and you won’t see it in your Collectibles anymore.

[![tonkeeper - step 5](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/3/35eaf2eae37ab76dba0d97b1128a8529bd30fe6f_2_232x500.png)

In this way we totally free **visually** hid scam NFT from Tonkeeper wallet.

But you can continue to see it in [tonscan](https://tonscan.org/) / [tonviewer](https://tonviewer.com/). If you don’t want scam NFT to be visible there too, then unfortunately there are only two options: either just wait, or send it to a zero burning address (highly not recommended): `UQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJKZ`.  
Please note that you will need to pay a network fee for the sending transaction.

### [](#mytonwallet-3)MyTonWallet

Unfortunately, this wallet **does not provide function of visually “hiding” NFTs**, which is a significant flaw in our case.

But it will help you quickly send scam NFT to a zero “burn” address.

* * *

In the **NFT** page click three dots near item you want to burn.

[![mytonwallet - step 1](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/1/1d3e7b5f121b935480386eedb5842e05e80bdc63_2_232x500.png)

* * *

Select **Burn**.

[![mytonwallet - step 2](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/7/79511658bfa470ca9ff3ac18f69e8ef66972fa63_2_232x500.png)

* * *

Next we will see **transaction page**, that was automatically created. The zero “burn” address is entered in the Receiving Address. Tap **Burn NFT**.

In this case **we need to pay network fee** for send transaction.

I believe that users **should not give any money for this action**, if we are talking about scam and users safety. And I think this should be resolved. That’s one of the reasons why I recommend Tonkeeper. Also, some NFTs have doubtful code in contracts, which can lead to unexpected consequences, so the following actions are at your own risk.

[![mytonwallet - step 3](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/1/19677a634cd552c34ca17e2802c7a4fd36f1b9b8_2_232x500.png)

* * *

As soon as the transaction is completed, we will see such a message and scam NFT will be deleted from our wallet **forever**.

Well, I clicked on two of them. Then I got suspicious and reported them as scams. I hope I didn’t do anything wrong. What do you think? Should I transfer my tokens to another wallet?

Hi! You don’t need to do anything else. **You did everything correctly ![:white_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:").**

This article can be considered as **outdated** because both popular wallets now have the function of marking NFT as a scam, then they will hide automatically (without the need to burn it or otherwise interact with it).
