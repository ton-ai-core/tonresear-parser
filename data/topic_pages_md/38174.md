## [](#p-62236-project-highlights-1)Project Highlights

Bridge23 is a platform that monetizes personal AI agents by training business AI agents using first-party data. Users train their own AI agents on personal data, which can be fine-tuned by businesses for a commission, providing privacy-focused and relevant AI-derived analytics. The platform aims to create a seamless experience for users and businesses alike, ensuring secure, efficient, and meaningful AI interactions.

## [](#p-62236-web3-advantages-2)Web3 Advantages

Unlike traditional Web2 data brokerage models, Bridge23 leverages decentralized Web3 principles to offer users full control over their personal data. By allowing users to train personal AI agents and have businesses fine-tune them for insights, we create a new, transparent data economy. Users are fairly compensated for their data usage, addressing a major flaw in Web2 data models, where users often donâ€™t receive any value from their shared data.

## [](#p-62236-how-its-built-3)How Itâ€™s Built

Bridge23 is built using a modular canister architecture on the Internet Computer, featuring:

*   AI Agent Fine-Tuning modules for both user and business AI agents
*   A real-time exchange rate canister
*   OCR and text recognition canister
*   Cross-chain NFT minting and EVM authentication canisters
*   Separate user canisters to ensure personalized AI training
*   Data transformation (to vector formats) for AI fine-tuning
*   Smart Contract for Payments\*\*: A TON-based smart contract is implemented to handle payments between businesses and users. When businesses use user data for AI fine-tuning, the smart contract automates the process of payments, ensuring secure, transparent, and traceable transactions. Payments are processed using fiat (via Stripe integration) or cryptocurrency, converting interactions with data into tangible earnings for users.

## [](#p-62236-go-to-market-strategy-4)Go-To-Market Strategy

Bridge23 will continue its multi-channel growth strategy, including:

*   Partnering with data-driven businesses to create real-world applications for AI agents
*   Offering incentives like referral programs where users and businesses earn by participating
*   Launching educational initiatives to teach users how to train their AI agents and monetize data
*   0% fee for early adopters to encourage more usage

## [](#p-62236-monetization-5)Monetization

*   Commissions on AI agent fine-tuning between users and businesses
*   Transaction fees on data insights or premium tools for merchants

## [](#p-62236-status-of-the-project-6)Status of the Project

Bridge23 is currently in its MVP stage, with over 5,000 users on the waitlist and more than 1,000 beta 0.10.0 users in TMA.
