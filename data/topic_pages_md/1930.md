## [](#describe-the-mechanism-of-providing-liquidity-on-your-platform-5)Describe the mechanism of providing liquidity on your platform

We are a DAO community. Main advantage is that we created a supportive environment for the innovation and kickstarting Web3 projects which manifests in a recent launch of Shardify protocol. The essence of the protocol is that every user can shard an NFT into smaller tokens or purchase parts of the NFT.

Currently, our protocol has added the Notcoin Pre-Market collection and a total of 24 thousand vouchers have been split into wTON.

Protocol link: [https://shardify.app/](https://shardify.app/)

## [](#your-plans-attach-a-document-6)Your Plans \[attach a document\]

You can provide 3 scenarios with the estimates for a potential duration of the incentives of 1, 3 and 6 months.
