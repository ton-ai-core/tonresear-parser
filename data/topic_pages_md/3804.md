We are a team of TON enthusiasts who have launched BABYTON, a token whose purpose is placed in a deep segment, thinking in an ecosystem integrated to the TON network babyton understands the importance of creating strategic forces to empower our network. We want to create an ecosystem where BABYTON will be its main token. Along with this we intend to create NTF’s that will support the liquidity of the token creating a robust base.
