A convenient and very useful service/bot for working with NFT collections.  
A reliable assistant who has never let you down. The founder is in touch, listens to users and their suggestions for improvements.  
In terms of security, everything is also excellent.  
I actively use this bot and can confidently recommend it.

[@Inal\_Kardan](/u/inal_kardan)  
from the 1 April my project has UAW=961 and N\_txs=51758.  
This is not the last place of App Leaderboard. As well as I didn’t try to push users in order to increase this metric and I count txs that I think need to count but users send even more txs via the bot into blockchain.
