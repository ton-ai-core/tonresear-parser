Exciting news for all Tonkeeper users! The long-awaited feature of managing multiple wallets is finally here. Now, you can add an unlimited number of your own wallets, create watch-only wallets to keep your keys safe outside the device, or even keep an eye on popular addresses. To help you navigate through your wallets with ease, you can customize each one with different colors and emojis. And yes, you heard it right - you can add as many wallets as you like!

But that’s not all! Tonkeeper now also offers token price charts. Simply click on a token in your balance to track its price movements. With the crypto market heating up, this feature couldn’t have come at a better time. Stay ahead of the game by keeping an eye on market trends right from your Tonkeeper app.

Setting up a new wallet has never been easier. Say goodbye to the tedious backup process - now, it only takes two clicks to get your wallet up and running. Just set a passcode, and voilà, your wallet is ready to go. Encourage your friends to join Tonkeeper and experience the world of crypto with the convenience and security they deserve.

Moreover, we’ve made some improvements to how tokens are organized. Tokens are now sorted by balance value, making it easier for you to find what you’re looking for. And to ensure clarity, unverified tokens are now grouped separately.

So what are you waiting for? Dive into the new and improved Tonkeeper experience and enjoy managing your crypto with unparalleled ease and security.
