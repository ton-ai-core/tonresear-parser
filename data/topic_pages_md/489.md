Our team has developed a new smart contract library called TonDynasty Contracts, aimed at accelerating the development of Tact language smart contracts. We provide a variety of reusable, highly customizable traits, implementing multiple TEP standards such as the jetton standard and nft standard. Developers can easily import the library and achieve customized logic requirements by using simple override functions.
