Laika initially launched on 27th of December as a response to many rug pulls and scams at the time.  
To try and set a good example, we burned the LP tokens and airdropped a majority of the supply to REDO, Ston and Scale holders.

Laika is not about empty promises, dapps, or revenue sharing.  
The ideas was simple, every chain needs a dog coin, and the Russian chain should have a Russian dog.

We did not raise money, we did not do a presale, and we did not sell any tokens.

I believe that once ‚Äòmemecoins‚Äô start trying to add utility to their tokens too early, it kills their essence and they become normal tokens.  
What is the utility of Doge, Pepe or WIF? Nothing, they‚Äôre fun.

One of our plans in development is creating an NFT collection that will be minted by burning Laika tokens. Currently looking for a developer who is able to help build this.

Hello Laika team,

Thank you for taking the time to apply for The Open League Season #1.

After a thorough review, we must inform you that, unfortunately, your token does not meet our current eligibility criteria. You can find them through this [link](https://tonresear.ch/t/about-the-memecoin-leaderboard-category/1276).

Once your token aligns with these criteria, please feel free to resubmit your application for the future seasons.

We look forward to seeing your application again in the future.

Thank you.
