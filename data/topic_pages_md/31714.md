**Mine2Mine — mining launchpad on TON.**  
Other coins for mining will be available soon!

**Mine2Mine is the first app that allows you to mine real GPU coins using virtual GPU graphics cards and taps.**

No more dealing with the complicated setup of mining — the Mine2Mine team has done it all for you. All you need to do is buy a virtual graphics card or simply start tapping to earn real GPU tokens, which can be immediately sold on decentralized exchanges.

The distribution of GPU started recently from mining pools, similar to how TON was distributed. In the future, the Mine2Mine app will allow mining of other tokens as well.

If you missed the opportunity to turn on your graphics card to mine TON, now is the perfect time to activate GPU while the project is in its early stages!
