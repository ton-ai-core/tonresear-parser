The The Open Network (TON) blockchain is a rapidly evolving platform, offering a new horizon for decentralized applications and services. While Linux has traditionally been the go-to environment for blockchain node operations, there’s a growing interest in exploring alternative operating systems, such as FreeBSD, for these tasks. This article delves into a detailed guide designed to facilitate the deployment of TON blockchain nodes—both full nodes and validators—on FreeBSD systems, catering to the unique requirements of this operating system.

**Introduction to FreeBSD and TON Blockchain**

FreeBSD is renowned for its robustness, advanced networking, security features, and performance, making it an attractive option for running blockchain nodes. The guide in focus provides a comprehensive walkthrough for setting up TON nodes on FreeBSD, aiming at the Newton Blockchain Testnet but applicable to other blockchains as well.

**Rationale for FreeBSD Adoption**

The motivation behind this guide is the scarcity of resources and ready-made solutions for deploying TON Blockchain nodes on FreeBSD. Most existing resources cater to Linux users, with a significant emphasis on Docker containers. However, for enthusiasts and professionals preferring FreeBSD, these solutions fall short. This guide fills this gap, offering tailored instructions for FreeBSD users.

**Guide Status and Future Developments**

Currently, the guide is a work in progress, with plans for substantial enhancements, including the development of a full binary package for FreeBSD. This future package aims to streamline the installation process, negating the need for manual compilation and installation. Additionally, there’s an ongoing effort to adapt the mytonctrl tool for FreeBSD, traditionally designed with a Linux focus.

**Guide Content Overview**

The guide is structured into several key sections, each targeting a specific aspect of TON node operation on FreeBSD:

Section

Description

Installation Guide

Details the process for building, installing, and launching TON binaries on FreeBSD systems.

Full Node Configuration

Outlines the steps to configure a TON network full node.

Validator Node Configuration

Provides guidance on setting up a TON network validator node.

DHT Server Configuration

Discusses configuring a TON network DHT server.

FAQ

Addresses frequently asked questions regarding TON on FreeBSD and other systems.

**Conclusion**

This guide serves as an essential resource for blockchain enthusiasts and professionals looking to leverage the power and flexibility of FreeBSD for TON node operations. It not only bridges the knowledge gap for FreeBSD users but also highlights the platform’s potential in hosting blockchain technologies. As the guide evolves, it promises to offer a more streamlined and accessible pathway for deploying TON nodes on FreeBSD, further diversifying the ecosystem and supporting the growth of the TON blockchain.

Through detailed instructions and continuous updates, this guide stands as a testament to the community’s dedication to expanding TON blockchain’s accessibility and operability across different operating systems, ensuring a broader range of users can participate in and contribute to its network.

In my past experience, operating TON blockchain nodes in Free BSD will be much more efficient. I once operated TON in Free BSD to achieve twice the speed.
