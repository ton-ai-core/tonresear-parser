I’m really excited to see the progress that $REGI has made over the past couple of months. My personal values, which include fighting against online censorship and advocating for internet freedom, align closely with this project. It also embodies what Telegram stands for, which is why they released the Resistance Girl as a native Telegram sticker pack.

Furthermore, I really like that it’s not just another dog or cat meme-based project; in fact, it’s the only female narrative project on the blockchain!

Beware of this scammers! Only 58% LP has been burnt and remaining 42% has been constantly dumped since 2M ATH, and the team thought they are smart by not sniping launch with wallets not linked to dev wallet but they caught with the source of deposit, we just checked and there’s multiple solana scams these guys did with the same method of just burning half the lp and pulling the remaining lp in a later stage.

would like to emphasize that If this REGI thing or anything deployed by this team ever gets accepted to the Open League, it would put a big shadow over Open League and the whole TON ecosystem. I’m a big supporter of TON myself and I would never want it to become scammer nest like SOLANA.

I am 100% confident you will perform a solid due diligence here.

To be honest, the REGI project they introduced with a Resistance theme is led by a group of serial scammers from a private Solana group. Their previous project is listed below called LARRY. If TON ever approves a project by this team, I’m confident the TON Foundation would regret choosing a project run by known scammers. They have half the liquidity pool unlocked, ready to execute a rug pull as soon as you list them.

Hi folks, Lily here!  
Didn’t really get that solana part so not sure what to make of your messages, but if you could post any proofs here I will initiate internal investigation gladly ![:slight_smile:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12 ":slight_smile:") ![:two_hearts:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/two_hearts.png?v=12 ":two_hearts:")

On the liquidity point - since we had liquidity contest with solid prizes, big part of the liquidity is held by our community, so we don’t have any control over this part. Team liquidity was however fully burned and the transaction is [here](https://tonscan.org/tx/DYair5UUDfnN8Hcx5qxvRP%2FkiKGx7U24BhmUQKCsR7o=)

Thanks everyone for your interest in $REGI and will be happy to see you in the club! Onwards!
