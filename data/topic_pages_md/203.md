The TON (The Open Network) blockchain offers a variety of APIs, each designed to facilitate different aspects of application development. This guide provides an overview of the primary APIs available for interacting with the TON blockchain, including both core and third-party options. Additionally, we cover specialized APIs for tasks such as fetching Toncoin rates and converting addresses between formats. Our aim is to help developers choose the most suitable API for their projects by comparing their features, security, and use cases.

## [](#conclusion-6)Conclusion

Choosing the right API depends on the specific requirements of your application, such as the need for real-time data, the type of data required, and the level of security necessary for your use case. While core TON APIs offer foundational access to blockchain data, third-party APIs can provide additional functionality, such as fast indexing, GraphQL support, and specialized data like NFTs. Additionally, APIs for Toncoin rates and address conversion are valuable tools for applications requiring financial data or user-friendly address formats.
