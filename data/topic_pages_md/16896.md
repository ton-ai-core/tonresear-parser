Hello, friends.

Please correct me if I am wrong.

After creating a wallet using the Tonkeeper example, I have an address wallet, its (future) base64 hash by V4 wallet code (simplified). If I change 1 byte in the code of the (future) contract - the address is different.

So I’m getting a TON to that address. If the TON is a Jetton, the sender needs to create a new TON contract to save my TON. But isn’t TON a jetton? What is TON? Where to store my TON data?
