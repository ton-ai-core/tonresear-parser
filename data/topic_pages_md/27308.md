Hello, this project has been found to be scamming the audience.  
It was confirmed that the scam affected 1500 wallets.

Here is an article with proof - [SCAM в Высшей лиге – Telegraph](https://telegra.ph/SCAM-v-Vysshej-lige-06-30)

It’s totally FUD.  
Project has been running for more than 2 years, it is being built only with community funds, the article contains only the whining of one person who cannot understand that development is hard work and is difficult to predict, no one has deceived anyone, approximate dates are given and it’s based on a different game altogether.

Your comment is deliberately misleading and should be removed.

Один из немногих проектов, которые реально дают возможность получить токены любому желающему.

Множество ивентов с наградами в токенах, которые может получить абсолютно любой.

Включается майнинг ПЕТ во время участия в лиге!!!

Я благодаря этому проекту получил стартовый капитал в крипте))) Всё во время ивентов и других активностях проекта!

Tongochi great project. Yes, launching of game was delayed, but we believe in project and team behind it. Why do we believe? Because Ilya and others founders speak honestly about process of creation of game. But they have a successful case and if it will be scam I guess there are more professional method about how to scam people. Tongochi is not scam.

You must have Stockholm syndrome, the article shows everything in black and white.  
You as holders of this garbage will defend, but people are not fools and especially in TF, they will see everything and convince themselves.

in the game for almost 2 years! everything is open and honest, without deception! I think the article is ordered

Offended boy, wipe your snot and go to sleep

You are so funny, Bro ![:sweat_smile:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=12 ":sweat_smile:") Really. How long are you in TON? How long are you in crypto? How much have you lost personally in $PET? With proofs, please.

A lot of TON projects are facing delays, when they are building from scratch. Some delays are caused by regulation, by wars, by technical issues and global crypto and financial markets conditions, independent from team’s desires and efforts. Basically, by lots of factors called force-major in world’s justice practice. The team is well known to all TON community, building its products for more than two years.

Then what kind of scam are you talking about? Are you kidding?

Have you seen those hundreds of pictures and worthless transactions in your wallet with promises of millions of TON and USDT ‘airdrops’. That’s how scam really looks like.

$PET, Tongochi and Zombietown is definitely not a scam. Delays? Yes. But definitely not a scam.

I’d recommend you to remove that your weird blaming post above. And let’s go and contribute in TON growth all together ![:ok_hand:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/ok_hand.png?v=12 ":ok_hand:")

Знаешь что , друг мой .  
От того что проект работал и что-то разрабатывал не исключает факта скама именно в данной ситуации .  
Когда происходят задержки , то об этом говориться в официальном сообщение .

Проект замечен в обмане , я об этом сообщил.  
Если ты так не думаешь , то это твоё мнение и не надо мне его навязывать .

И то что ты рассказываешь про примеры скама с раздачами и спамом , это попытка скама . Да есть кто ведётся .  
Но тут проект ZombieTown от Tongochi заскамил 1500 человек и это факт.
