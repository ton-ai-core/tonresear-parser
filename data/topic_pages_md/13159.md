> Airdrop snapshot: April 23, 08.00 am CEST  
> Airdrop execution: April 25

### [](#eligibility-criteria-1)Eligibility criteria

The snapshot captures all wallets that performed deals on [Getgems](https://getgems.io/), [xRare](https://t.me/xrareclub), and [TON Diamonds](https://ton.diamonds/) **between April 11 (2pm CEST) and April 23 (8am CEST)**. Sales by NFT collection owners, non-wallet addresses and sybil wallet addresses were disqualified.

Whitelisted assets included **all NFT collections on the 3 above-mentioned NFT marketplaces** (not endorsement or investment advice).

To be eligible for the airdrop, the wallet needed to perform **at least 2 NFT deals** during the indicated period.

The metrics taken into account to calculate each eligible wallet score are as follows:

*   Number of NFT collections traded
*   Number of NFT deals performed
*   Total NFT trading volume
*   Purchase percentage (on the scale from 0 to 100, where 0 is assigned to wallets with no NFT purchases and only sales, and 100 is assigned to wallets with no NFT sales and only purchases)
*   Current number of NFT on the balance
*   Current value of NFT on the balance

With the aim of determining the size of the airdrop for each beneficiary, a points system was created. Based on the 6 above-mentioned metrics, each wallet was assigned points. The sum of the points was the final score. Final scores including or above the median (with the exceptions for Total NFT trading volume, Purchase percentage and Current value of NFT on the balance where the minimum required value was below the median) were then grouped into ranges and the size of rewards for each range of scores was determined.
