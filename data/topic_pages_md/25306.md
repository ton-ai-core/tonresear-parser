Hello team,

Thank you for taking the time to apply for The Open League.

After a thorough review, we must inform you that, unfortunately, your project does not meet our current eligibility criteria and is not eligible because you applied after the application period. You can find the eligibility criteria through this link: [About the Token & Memecoin Battle category](https://tonresear.ch/t/about-the-token-memecoin-battle-category/1274/)

We look forward to seeing your application again in the future.

Thank you.
