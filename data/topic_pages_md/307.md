PyTONLib emerges as a pivotal tool for developers venturing into the TON Blockchain ecosystem, offering a Python-based library that interfaces seamlessly with `libtonlibjson`. This library is instrumental for those seeking to engage with TON Blockchain without the overhead of managing extensive infrastructural requirements. It simplifies the interaction with TON’s LiteServer, providing an asynchronous client that brings efficiency and speed to blockchain operations.

### [](#pytonlib-features-overview-1)PyTONLib Features Overview

The library is distinguished by its ability to connect to a single LiteServer, offering an asynchronous client framework that does not support request caching. This design choice ensures a streamlined and efficient communication channel with the TON Blockchain, suitable for applications requiring real-time data with minimal latency.

### [](#installation-guide-2)Installation Guide

PyTONLib supports multiple operating systems, including Windows, Mac, and Linux, with the prerequisite of an Intel CPU architecture. Installation involves a simple package addition via pip for Python 3, alongside specific requirements for Windows users to install OpenSSL v1.1.1 for Win64.

#### [](#table-1-installation-requirements-and-steps-3)Table 1: Installation Requirements and Steps

Operating System

Requirements

Installation Command

Windows

OpenSSL v1.1.1 for Win64

`pip3 install pytonlib`

Mac/Linux

`pip3 install pytonlib`

For Docker enthusiasts, a Compose file is provided to deploy a Jupyter Notebook service, illustrating the practical application of PyTONLib in a containerized environment.

### [](#practical-examples-4)Practical Examples

#### [](#initial-setup-5)Initial Setup

The initialization process involves downloading the mainnet configuration and setting up a keystore directory. This setup is crucial for the secure management of cryptographic keys and the client’s configuration.

```
# Example: Initializing TonlibClient with mainnet configuration
import requests
from pathlib import Path
from pytonlib import TonlibClient

ton_config = requests.get('https://ton.org/global.config.json').json()
keystore_dir = '/tmp/ton_keystore'
Path(keystore_dir).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
client = TonlibClient(ls_index=0, config=ton_config, keystore=keystore_dir)
await client.init()
```

#### [](#interacting-with-the-blockchain-6)Interacting with the Blockchain

PyTONLib facilitates various blockchain interactions, from retrieving masterchain information to reading block transactions. These operations are essential for applications that require access to blockchain data, such as wallets, explorers, or decentralized applications.

```
# Example: Reading blocks info and transactions
masterchain_info = await client.get_masterchain_info()
block_header = await client.get_block_header(**masterchain_info['last'])
txs = await client.get_block_transactions(**masterchain_info['last'], count=10)
```

### [](#running-asynchronous-code-7)Running Asynchronous Code

A standout feature of PyTONLib is its asynchronous capability, which is particularly beneficial in a scripting environment. This feature allows for non-blocking operations, making it ideal for high-performance applications that require concurrent processing.

```
# Example: Running async code from script
async def main():
    ton_config = requests.get('https://ton.org/global.config.json').json()
    keystore_dir = '/tmp/ton_keystore'
    Path(keystore_dir).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    client = TonlibClient(ls_index=0, config=ton_config, keystore=keystore_dir)
    await client.init()
    masterchain_info = await client.get_masterchain_info()
    await client.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### [](#conclusion-8)Conclusion

PyTONLib presents a robust and efficient pathway for Python developers to interact with the TON Blockchain. Its asynchronous client, coupled with the ability to directly connect to a LiteServer, provides a streamlined framework for developing blockchain applications. Through the examples provided, developers can quickly integrate blockchain functionalities into their Python applications, leveraging the full potential of TON Blockchain with minimal setup and overhead.
