### [](#introduction-1)Introduction

Deploying sites on the TON (Telegram Open Network) blockchain is made significantly easier with the TON Proxy Docker. This tool streamlines the process of running the [rldp-http-proxy](https://ton.org/docs/#/web3/sites-and-proxy?id=running-ton-site) in a Docker container, enabling users to deploy their sites on the TON network efficiently. This document outlines the hardware requirements, setup instructions, and configuration options for using TON Proxy Docker.

### [](#hardware-requirements-2)Hardware Requirements

The table below outlines the minimum hardware requirements for building TON binaries and running the TON Proxy Docker:

Specification

RAM

At least 2 GB

### [](#running-the-proxy-3)Running the Proxy

Deploying your site on the TON network involves several straightforward steps:

1.  **Configuration in Docker-Compose**: Set the TON repository branch in the `docker-compose.yml` file under the `rldp-proxy.build.args` section.
2.  **Building the Image**: Build the Docker image with the command `docker-compose build`.
3.  **Initializing Proxy Configuration**:
    *   Run `./init.sh` to generate a new ADNL ID, download the mainnet configuration, and create a `.env` file with settings.
    *   If an ADNL ID already exists, place it in `private/adnl` and `private/adnl-hex`, and copy the contents of your `keyring` file into `adnl-private`.
4.  **Launching the Proxy**: Start the proxy using `docker-compose up -d`. This assumes the site is already operational on port 80 on the same machine.
5.  **ADNL Address**: The `private/adnl` file contains the user-friendly ADNL form. Use this address to access your site.

### [](#proxy-settings-4)Proxy Settings

Configuration settings for the TON Proxy are managed in the `.env` file located at the repository’s root. The table below details these settings and their purposes:

Setting

Description

`TON_PROXY_PORT=8080`

Specifies the HTTP listening port.

`TON_PROXY_SERVER_IP`

Your server’s public IP. Use `curl https://ipinfo.io/ip` to retrieve your IP.

`TON_PROXY_ADNL_PORT=3333`

Defines the port for ADNL queries.

`TON_PROXY_REMOTE_ADDR`

The address where HTTP requests are proxied. Change to direct requests to a different machine.

`TON_PROXY_VERBOSITY=3`

Sets the verbosity level. A value of `0` is recommended for production environments.

`TON_PROXY_PROXY_ALL=NO`

Determines whether to proxy all HTTP requests. By default, only \*.ton and \*.adnl requests are proxied.

### [](#conclusion-5)Conclusion

The TON Proxy Docker offers a simplified solution for deploying sites on the TON blockchain, eliminating the complexity associated with manual proxy configuration and deployment. By following the provided setup instructions and adjusting the proxy settings as needed, users can efficiently establish their presence on the TON network, leveraging its decentralized architecture for enhanced security and accessibility.
