*   Paper Plane ($PLANE)
*   [x.com](https://x.com/paperplane_ton)
*   Paper $PLANE is a memecoin based on the historic moment when Russia tried to ban Telegram in 2018 and Pavel Durov called on everyone to throw paper planes as a sign of resistance.

A paper plane is also associated with the iconic Telegram logo. Although $PLANE has no association with Telegram, the $PLANE logo is a mix of the old Telegram logo created in 2013 fused with the most current Telegram logo created in 2019.

Not only is $PLANE a memecoin with a timeless narrative, $PLANE has developed an addictive game playable directly as a Telegram app. This game has been used to bring awareness to the TON ecosystem by forging collaborations with other projects on TON.

Paper planes are timeless and knows no boundaries as they fly free and effortlessly, or better yet, as the founder of Telegram says,  
“The original meaning of the paper plane on the Telegram logo means freedom.”

*   $PLANE was a fair launch and is now a Community Take Over project so there are no team tokens. All expenses are paid for by the community raising money. All of the LP has been burned.

Very excited to see $PLANE grow as one of the bluechip projects on TON with a strong narrative like this

Longevity speaks for itself. A standout project in the vast onchain PVP market
