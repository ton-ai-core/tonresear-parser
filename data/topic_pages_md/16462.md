Hello there  
This is @b\_ok2 .  
I report about my problem to @ton\_help\_bot and they say you used some custom sales contract so your trades were not counted!!!  
What?!!!  
Dude it’s Blockchain, neither of us can lie ![:lying_face:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/lying_face.png?v=12 ":lying_face:").  
So why would I bother?!  
During the required time I had 3 sale’s: 2 from gomining whales and another from pixels (both of them introduced by foundation)  
2 point.  
And at the time I had more than 41 NFTs inside of my wallet (NFTs+SBTs)  
2 point.  
So already I AM eligible but story doesn’t ends here .  
And at the time I had more than 1000 us dollar on volume (which is 3 points!!)  
And many number of deals.  
So , easy math 2+2+3=7.  
But I received 0 ![:neutral_face:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/neutral_face.png?v=12 ":neutral_face:").  
And nobody seems to care …
