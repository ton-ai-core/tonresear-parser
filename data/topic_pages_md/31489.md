I‚Äôve been playing Bee Harvest for over two months now, and in that time I‚Äôve never had the thought of it being another boring game in catalog.  
Players join clans and help each other, and the developers in turn work hard every for product improvement. The team is very brave indeed, as they are creating a product unlike any other. I am sure they will be able to reach many millions of bees in their family.

Bee Harvest is an economic strategy game. It allows you to earn AMBR token with the possibility to withdraw it to DEX.  
Bee Harvest game is created on the TON blockchain. It belongs to the Play-to-Earn genre. The token listing is promised from the first day of the game‚Äôs public release.  
Bee Harvest‚Äôs tokenomics are thoughtful and effective. It includes an option such as daily distribution of AMBR tokens to players via square root. It is possible to start the game without any financial investment. The creators guarantee the listing of HONEY on crypto exchanges immediately after the official launch. Your apiary is profitable even when you are offline, ensuring a steady inflow of HONEY. Although the game is in beta testing, Bee harvest already offers an interesting and exciting experience + bonuses in the form of additional multipliers and free NFTs!

Great project! The only one of its kind. It is clear that the developers are trying to make the game even better and more interesting, unlike many other projects where you need to sit and poke your finger at the screen from morning to evening, it is not clear why. I would like to wish them success and further development for the better.
