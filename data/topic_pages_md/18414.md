# [](#key-features-of-tonsquare-2)Key Features of TONSquare

## [](#interoperability-3)Interoperability

TONSquareâ€™s bridge technology enables secure communication between The Open Network (TON) and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible chains. This unlocks new opportunities for decentralized applications and cross-chain transactions.

## [](#network-rewards-4)Network Rewards

Key holders earn $TOS tokens as rewards, which are given out based on node uptime, network health, and other performance measures. This reward system ensures that active participants are fairly compensated for their contributions

## [](#security-and-governance-5)Security and Governance

TONSquare uses strong security measures, like advanced encryption and regular audits, to protect its network. A decentralized governance model ensures that decision-making is transparent and inclusive

## [](#developer-ecosystem-6)Developer Ecosystem

TONSquare aims to attract a lively developer community by offering tools, documentation, and incentives that make building on the network easy

# [](#tonsquare-key-7)TONSquare Key

The TONSquare Key is a specialized non-fungible token (NFT) that serves as a mandatory license for operating a node within the TONSquare network. This NFT certifies a nodeâ€™s eligibility to submit claims and collect rewards, integrating critical functions into the networkâ€™s framework

Buying keys now would enable you to be part of the initial minting of $TOS tokens, each key will enable you to earn $TOS as if you are staking. There is also an on-going airdrop for wallets with 100+ TON, with a random airdrop value between 20k - 500k $TOS.

Secure your access key!
