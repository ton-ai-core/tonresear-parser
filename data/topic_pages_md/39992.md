It seems like the Open League Github pipeline not running, which is why we couldn’t pass when creating the pull request:

[github.com/ton-society/the-open-league](https://github.com/ton-society/the-open-league/pull/251)

#### [Add Catton Project](https://github.com/ton-society/the-open-league/pull/251)

We’ve resolved the conflicts many times, but because it not is approved and the pipeline not running, then we are resolving it daily. Can you help to check it soon to approve ?
