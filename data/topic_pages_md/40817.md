### [](#p-67292-since-2013-ive-been-a-bitcoin-researcher-and-translator-of-mastering-bitcoin-chinese-editionhttpsmastering-bitcoindogetg-1)Since 2013, I’ve been a Bitcoin researcher and translator of _Mastering Bitcoin_ ([Chinese Edition](https://mastering-bitcoin.doge.tg/)).

I’ve witnessed every milestone - from early Bitcoin communities to exchange evolution, from Ethereum’s birth to TON & Telegram ecosystem growth, and now Bitcoin ETF approval.

With BTC reaching $100,000, I’m both grateful and amazed by how far we’ve come. Let me share this remarkable decade in Bitcoin. ![:writing_hand:t2:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/writing_hand/2.png?v=12 ":writing_hand:t2:")

## [](#p-67292-i-introduction-my-bitcoin-journey-2)I. Introduction: My Bitcoin Journey

In 2013, as a 20-year-old student, I was captivated by the emerging blockchain technology when I first encountered Bitcoin.

Many have asked why I haven’t achieved so-called financial freedom. Indeed, I met peers who took bold risks, even selling their homes to purchase Bitcoin at just $200. However, I lacked sufficient savings to invest and couldn’t fully grasp Bitcoin’s potential at the time. In 2014, I tried borrowing $3,000 from my parents to buy Bitcoin, but they refused.

Looking back, their decision might have been the right one—no one could foresee Bitcoin’s future. Perhaps it is this very uncertainty that makes Bitcoin such a challenging and fascinating asset.

In 2014, Bitcoin made headlines across Taiwan when its price surpassed $1,000 for the first time. My curiosity deepened after discussing this with my roommate. Though I initially understood the basics from Wikipedia, encouragement from my professor led me to explore Bitcoin’s technical aspects more deeply.

Beyond my studies, I joined Bitcoin communities on Facebook, where enthusiasts shared insights. I analyzed cryptocurrency exchanges like BTC-e, Poloniex, OKCoin, and Huobi, studying their operational logic. I also experimented with trading bots and arbitrage strategies, gaining firsthand experience of crypto market risks and challenges.

## [](#p-67292-iii-technological-breakthroughs-and-community-building-4)III. Technological Breakthroughs and Community Building

In 2014, I began serious academic research into Bitcoin’s technologies: decentralized networks, cryptographic hashing, and the Hashcash algorithm. This interdisciplinary exploration led me to Academia Sinica in 2015, where I studied the Tor network alongside Bitcoin.

Tor’s privacy mechanisms helped me understand Bitcoin’s pseudonymity and inspired new research questions about network security.

Simultaneously, I built the largest Chinese Bitcoin Community on Facebook, connected with industry pioneers, and attended early Bitcoin meetups. These gatherings provided invaluable insights and strengthened the community’s commitment to blockchain innovation.

In 2014, the global Bitcoin community explored practical applications of Bitcoin as a universal payment tool. Despite challenges like slow transactions and high fees, the community innovated relentlessly. The Lightning Network emerged as a solution, enabling faster and cheaper transactions.

## [](#p-67292-v-blockchain-evolution-ethereum-and-decentralization-6)V. Blockchain Evolution: Ethereum and Decentralization

Ethereum’s introduction of smart contracts transformed blockchain, expanding applications to DeFi and DApps. Innovations like Cosmos’ Proof of Stake (PoS) reduced energy consumption, while technologies like ZK-SNARKs advanced privacy and scalability.

## [](#p-67292-vi-ton-blockchain-advancing-the-payment-ecosystem-7)VI. TON Blockchain: Advancing the Payment Ecosystem

As an early Bitcoiner, my focus has always been on crypto’s payment potential. In 2021, I joined the TON Core Team to advance TON Blockchain, which integrates decentralized storage, Lightning Network, dPoS consensus, and sharding.

With 1.4 billion registered Telegram users, TON offers unparalleled payment solutions. I founded [@TONX\_Studio](https://x.com/@TONX_Studio) and launched [@TONXAPI](https://x.com/@TONXAPI) to provide robust infrastructure for developers.

This decade-long journey has witnessed Bitcoin’s rise from $200 to $100,000 and growing institutional acceptance. By 2025, all pieces will align: USDT stability, Telegram’s vast network, and TON’s advanced infrastructure.

The payment revolution envisioned by Bitcoin pioneers is becoming reality.
