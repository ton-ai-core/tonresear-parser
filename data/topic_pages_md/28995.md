Hello,

I’ve only just begun my time with TON, but I started on something that I think will solve all sorts of problems for many. It’s a feed viewer that can be curated. Connect your wallet and that feeds the rest of the app to load the entire feed, as well as a section for My Live Feed. There are search options to filter, including by address. The data can be exported to json. @'ing handles should create associations on the backend, so eventually I should be able to sort by “most popular”.

If there’s interest, I’ll work on a Telegram game where the user mimics creating new passwords by circling their finger on their phone, “generating randomness” for passwords.

I’d love to hear feedback. I am, however, unable to use the API effectively at the moment, I’m either rate limited or locked out completely.

Thank you for your time and I hope we get to meet together,  
G
