# [](#setting-up-a-gram-token-miner-on-windows-a-comprehensive-guide-1)**Setting Up a GRAM Token Miner on Windows: A Comprehensive Guide**

Greetings, TON Community!

Today, I’m excited to share with you a step-by-step guide on setting up a miner for the GRAM token on your Windows machine. This guide is designed for individuals with a basic understanding of blockchain technology and those interested in contributing to the TON network’s computational power.

## [](#prerequisites-2)**Prerequisites**

Before we dive into the setup process, ensure you have the following:

*   A Windows-operated computer.
*   A GPU with CUDA or OpenCL drivers installed.
*   NodeJs installed on your system. You can download it from [NodeJs official website](https://nodejs.org/en).

## [](#step-1-configuration-3)**Step 1: Configuration**

1.  **Create a `config.txt` File:** First, create a text file named `config.txt` in your mining directory. This file will store your mnemonic (a series of words generated by your TON wallet) and optionally a TONAPI token for enhanced API stability.
    
2.  **Enter Your Mnemonic:** Open `config.txt` and enter your mnemonic in the format shown below:
    
    ```
    SEED=word1 word2 word3 ... wordN
    TONAPI_TOKEN=your_tonapi_token_here (optional)
    ```
    
    Replace `word1 word2 word3 ... wordN` with your actual mnemonic words. If you’re using TonApi as your API provider, enter your token next to `TONAPI_TOKEN=`.
    

## [](#step-2-wallet-activation-4)**Step 2: Wallet Activation**

Activate your v4r2 wallet by sending some funds to it. Then, perform a transaction to your own wallet address. This step ensures that your wallet is ready to receive mined tokens.

## [](#step-3-install-nodejs-5)**Step 3: Install NodeJs**

If you haven’t already, install NodeJs on your computer. NodeJs is essential for running the mining software. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en).

## [](#step-4-start-mining-6)**Step 4: Start Mining**

To start the mining process, open the `start_tonhub.bat` file if you’re using a CUDA GPU. For AMD GPU users, open `start_tonhub_amd.bat` instead.

### [](#tonapi-usage-7)**TonApi Usage**

Optionally, you can use TonApi ([tonconsole.com](http://tonconsole.com)) as your API provider for increased stability. However, it requires a token to operate. For a single miner, a free token is sufficient. To mine with TonApi, use the `start_tonapi_X.bat` or `start_tonapi_X.sh` files, where `X` is replaced with your GPU type.

### [](#multi-gpu-support-8)**Multi GPU Support**

For those with multiple GPUs, you can run several video cards with one script. See `start_multi_8.sh` or `start_multi_8.bat` for examples. To convert any start script to multi-GPU, replace `send_universal` with `send_multigpu` and set the `--gpu-count X` to the number of your GPUs.

## [](#conclusion-9)**Conclusion**

Mining GRAM tokens is a fantastic way to support the TON network while potentially earning rewards. This guide is intended to simplify the setup process for Windows users. If you encounter any issues or have further questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to the community for assistance.

Happy mining, and let’s contribute to the growth and security of the TON blockchain together!
