The TON (The Open Network) Blockchain introduces a sophisticated framework for the creation and management of extracurrencies, extending beyond its native cryptocurrency, Toncoin. This paper delves into the mechanisms of extra currency minting within the TON ecosystem, as outlined in the TON Blockchain Whitepaper and through its configuration parameters. We explore the low-level and high-level minting flows, highlighting the operational nuances and potential challenges encountered in the minting process.

## [](#overview-of-extracurrency-in-ton-blockchain-1)Overview of Extracurrency in TON Blockchain

TON Blockchain facilitates the definition of arbitrary cryptocurrencies or tokens, identifiable by 32-bit `currency_ids`. These extracurrencies are incorporated into the blockchain’s configuration and interact seamlessly within the ecosystem. The framework for managing these currencies is embedded within the blockchain’s masterchain, with specific configuration parameters (`ConfigParam 6`, `ConfigParam 7`, and `ConfigParam 2`) governing the minting process and the Minter’s operational dynamics.

### [](#configuration-parameters-and-minting-process-2)Configuration Parameters and Minting Process

The minting mechanism is governed by several configuration parameters:

Config Parameter

Description

`ConfigParam 7`

Stores the `ExtraCurrencyCollection`, detailing the currencies to be minted.

`ConfigParam 6`

Defines the minting fees: `mint_new_price` for creating new currencies and `mint_add_price` for minting additional tokens.

`ConfigParam 2`

Specifies the address of the Minter responsible for minting operations.

### [](#minting-flow-analysis-3)Minting Flow Analysis

The minting process operates on two levels: low-level and high-level flows. At the low level, a collator assesses the global balance of all currencies and generates a minting message if the `ConfigParam7` indicates a higher balance requirement for any currency. This message, however, contains only extracurrencies and no Toncoins, potentially leading to an aborted transaction due to insufficient gas.

The high-level flow introduces a more complex sequence, where the Minter smart contract validates minting requests, checks for authorization, and interacts with the configuration contract to update the `ExtraCurrencyCollection`. A notable workaround involves sending a message to a guaranteed bounce address (`0:0000...0000`) to defer the processing of minting requests, a mechanism that, while effective, presents its own set of challenges.

### [](#challenges-and-considerations-4)Challenges and Considerations

The implementation of extracurrency minting in TON raises several issues that necessitate resolution:

*   **Processing Workaround**: The use of a bounce message for deferred request processing is unconventional and may introduce operational inefficiencies.
*   **Minting Failures**: The framework must robustly handle scenarios where minting fails, ensuring clarity and predictability for currency owners.
*   **Burning Mechanisms**: The current structure lacks a straightforward method for burning extracurrencies, a feature that could enhance currency management flexibility.
*   **Minting Fees**: The economic implications of minting fees and the potential for blockchain bloat due to an unbounded number of extracurrencies warrant careful consideration.

## [](#conclusion-5)Conclusion

The TON Blockchain’s approach to extracurrency minting reflects its commitment to innovation and scalability. However, the intricacies of its implementation, from the use of specialized configuration parameters to the operational challenges encountered, underscore the need for ongoing refinement. As TON continues to evolve, addressing these challenges will be crucial in realizing its full potential as a versatile and dynamic blockchain ecosystem.
