Our liquidity pool was formed after the launch of a jetton on the tonnraffles platform. Lliquidity pool is uploaded to the [dedust.io](http://dedust.io) dex. Liquidity pool is growing organically, we do not boost it additionally.

## [](#your-plans-6)Your Plans

We specialize in creating various bots that can be useful in the TON ecosystem. At the moment we have ready - a bot for organizing access to private chats of holders and a bot that displays all token transactions. A bot for mass distribution of TONs and jettons will be ready soon.

*   [Telegram: Contact @liberta\_chatbot](http://t.me/liberta_chatbot)
*   [Telegram: Contact @free\_swapbot](http://t.me/free_swapbot) (you can see the work of the bot in the chat - [Telegram: Contact @freedom\_ton\_chat](http://t.me/freedom_ton_chat)).

In the future we also plan to develop bots, with monetization for our jetton $FREE

We realize that our performance is still not enough for the Open League, but we still leave the application because we believe that our project can benefit the TON blockchain.

A great project with good utilities. Freedom is just at the beginning of its journey, the guys from the freedom team are creating good utilities that can help the token develop in the future. Therefore, the token has great prospects. The creator of the project is always in touch, quick to respond, responsible and honest. Users from the freedom chat, very satisfied, will always answer all questions. I really like the Freedom crypto project, as I see great prospects in it.

For me, as a newcomer to crypto this is one of the most interesting projects. Its strength lies in the strong community and enthusiasm of the developers. They always answer any questions quickly and honestly and know their business well.

I believe FREE has huge prospects, and the game announcement and excellent NFT collection will help it grow faster than its competitors.

Free is an interesting project, I advise everyone to take a closer look. There are good chances that it will give a lot of profit to the holders.

\*The NFT collection is released  
\*An interesting game is in development  
\*The team is always in touch with the community.  
\*The community has a friendly atmosphere.  
\*The price of the coin is low, but at any moment it can rise in price.

I wish success to FREE community and development team. To the moon and higher!

Мое мнение - когда я узнал об этом проекте мне сразу в голову пришла идея может стоит заниматься криптой, и после этого проекта я начел активно изучать крипту. Как по мне этот проект один из лучших.
