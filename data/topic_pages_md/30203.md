Is it possible to check the user’s account creation date??

I’m testing the tdlib, TMA.

I tested TMA locally by React project, so that I can get the information of mine using “window.Telegram.WebApp.initDataUnsafe.user”.

And I’m trying to uae tdlib by python flask.

Check the user’s information on the frontend first, and then request the api using the information to get user’s account creation date and another.

Is it possible?
