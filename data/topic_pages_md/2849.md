Attach a link or a document (of any format) that describes your current, specifically UAW (total, monthly, daily), N of tx (monthly) and Retention D1, D7, D14. Please include proofs of this traction.  
Deer has a unique economic model, with 50% of its supply allocated for IDO on the Tonup platform, another 25% distributed to form LP, and the remaining part will be used entirely for LP addition or burning. The launch was fair, with no pre-allocation to the team.

Hello DEER team,

Thank you for taking the time to apply for The Open League Season #1.

After a thorough review, we must inform you that, unfortunately, your token does not meet our current eligibility criteria. You can find them through this [link](https://tonresear.ch/t/about-the-memecoin-leaderboard-category/1276).

Once your token aligns with these criteria, please feel free to resubmit your application for the future seasons.

We look forward to seeing your application again in the future.

Thank you.
