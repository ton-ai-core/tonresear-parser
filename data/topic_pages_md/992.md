[Notcoin Pre-Market is open](https://getgems.io/notcoin) ![:gem:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/gem.png?v=12 ":gem:")

For the first time, you can buy and sell Notcoin before the token launch.

Those who were good at mining, invited friends and were active with campaigns: you can now convert your Notcoin game balance into 10M Notcoin Vouchers (NFT) and trade them on Getgems (peer-to-peer).

Vouchers can be exchanged for $NOT after the token launch.  
Or you can wait until the token launch and convert your balance to $NOT directly.

No one knows what the price of $NOT token will be. The listing price may even be zero, so take that into account when trading vouchers.

Pre-Market supports $NOT listings through Royalties: 20% from NFT purchases go to liquidity for token listings.

**We are gradually rolling out this functionality** **to reduce the load, so** **please be patient**.
