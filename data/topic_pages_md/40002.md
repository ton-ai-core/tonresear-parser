Hey team!

We checked your tx example - and there is no ref code was used so it is not possible to track it. But if you can add referral address, after that we were able to add them, please add it to your document or reply here

Hello, I am a member of PumpMeme. We want to apply to participate in The Open League, but we cannot create it in the DEFI category. Instead, we create it under the theme of the Open League. Can you help me solve this problem? Thank you.

Hey [@Pump\_MEME](/u/pump_meme) - you probably meant to post on a different channel. You should reach out to the Open League team by making a post in the root of this forum.

Thanks for your reply [@Rusty](/u/rusty) . I posted a thread in The Open League section, but the official staff has not contacted me yet, so I am thinking about whether I can contact them through this method [@openleaguesupport](/u/openleaguesupport) . I originally wanted to post in the Defi League category, but that is not allowed.
