With an earnest heart, we strive to excel in every task at hand, driven by our desire to bring joy to everyone we encounter. ![:partying_face:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/partying_face.png?v=12 ":partying_face:")

Seeds does not seek to convince you of anything; indeed, we do not ask for anything from you. ![:laughing:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/laughing.png?v=12 ":laughing:")

Instead, we aspire for you and your friends to find happiness in gaming, reaping rewards along the way. ![:blush:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/blush.png?v=12 ":blush:")

Seeds is free, offering you the opportunity to assist anyone in need through the medium of gaming, and just as easily, to receive help from others. ![:star_struck:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/star_struck.png?v=12 ":star_struck:")

Your joy is our joy, and in this moment, that is all that matters. ![:nerd_face:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/nerd_face.png?v=12 ":nerd_face:")

Look forward to the next phase, which promises to be even more intriguing and enjoyable.![:sunglasses:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/sunglasses.png?v=12 ":sunglasses:")
