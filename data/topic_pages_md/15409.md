As part of our project focused on building an ecosystem around the OpenCoin token, we aim to provide access to cryptocurrency transactions, from the payment process to participation in trading operations. Our strategy is to develop a set of services that will support the use of OpenCoin as a universal means of payment. The goal is to create an infrastructure capable of meeting users’ needs for convenient and secure handling of cryptocurrency at all stages of transactions.
