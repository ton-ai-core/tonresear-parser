**TMONK** draws inspiration from Pavel Durov’s vision, aiming to pioneer change within the **TON** ecosystem. **TMONK** is more than just a meme. We aim to become the first project dedicated to crowdfunding and donations on the **TON** network.

**CROWDFUNDING**

At the moment, we are developing a dense network of partnerships and collaborations with numerous projects within the **TON ecosystem**, ranging from meme projects to utility projects. We firmly believe that collaboration among projects, mutual support, and cohesion can only benefit the entire TON ecosystem. We provide all our partners with the opportunity to showcase their projects and to receive assistance for any needs directly from us or from our collaborators within our network (development, marketing, graphics, etc.). The **TON network** is unique because projects do not compete or engage in warfare; instead, they collaborate and cooperate to create something innovative together. For this reason, we have placed our focus entirely on this network.

**CHARITY**

We can make a positive impact in the world beyond the blockchain, thanks to it. We have chosen **TON** and **TELEGRAM** to reach millions of people due to the ease of use, speed, and simplicity of the network. We have already made two donations to **Save The Children**. During the donation process, we noticed the impossibility of using **TON** as a method to make donations. For this reason, we have held several meetings with this foundation to help them implement their service with our beloved **TON network**. We have formed a lifelong partnership with our ambassador, Jeribond.ton, who has worked in the social sector for years and is an influential figure within the **TON ecosystem**.
