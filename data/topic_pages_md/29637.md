Telegram, with its vast user base of approximately 800 million, provides a unique distribution channel for games. Instead of relying on traditional app stores like the App Store or Google Play, games can be launched directly within the Telegram app using the Telegram Web Apps (TWA) API. This seamless integration allows for a smoother user experience and better retention rates, leveraging existing Web2 user acquisition tools

The TON blockchain enhances this experience by offering a fast and cost-effective solution, capable of processing over 1 million transactions per second with minimal fees. This efficiency is critical for gaming applications, where quick transactions are often necessary for gameplay and in-game purchases.
