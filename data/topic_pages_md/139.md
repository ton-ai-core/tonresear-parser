The TON Storage Daemon represents a pivotal advancement in the decentralized file-sharing sphere, leveraging the robust framework of The Open Network (TON) to offer an efficient, secure method for distributing and accessing data across the blockchain. This document provides an in-depth analysis of the TON Storage Daemon, contrasting its capabilities with traditional file-sharing mechanisms and delving into its operational specifics, hardware requirements, and key functionalities.

### [](#comparison-of-ton-storage-daemon-and-traditional-file-sharing-systems-1)Comparison of TON Storage Daemon and Traditional File-Sharing Systems

Feature

TON Storage Daemon

Traditional File-Sharing Systems

**Decentralization**

Fully decentralized, leveraging TON’s blockchain

Centralized or partially decentralized

**Security**

Enhanced with end-to-end encryption

Variable, often lacks E2E encryption

**Data Integrity**

Utilizes merkle proofs for data verification

Relies on standard hash checks

**Network Infrastructure**

Operates on TON’s ADNL and RLDP protocols

Uses traditional TCP/IP protocols

**Data Distribution Method**

Employs a unique overlay for each “Bag of Files”

Standard peer-to-peer sharing

**Cost Efficiency**

Minimal network fees, paid in TON

Potentially high operational costs

**Resilience to Failures**

High, due to decentralized nature

Susceptible to server outages

**Ease of Integration**

Direct support for various platforms via SDKs

Requires third-party tools and services

### [](#hardware-requirements-and-operational-setup-2)Hardware Requirements and Operational Setup

The TON Storage Daemon is designed to be lightweight and accessible, requiring minimal hardware resources, thus making it suitable for a wide range of users and applications. The table below outlines the basic hardware requirements for running the daemon:

Requirement

Specification

**CPU**

At least 1GHz and 2 cores

**RAM**

At least 2 GB

**SSD**

At least 2 GB (excluding data storage)

**Network Bandwidth**

10 Mb/s with static IP

### [](#key-concepts-and-functionalities-3)Key Concepts and Functionalities

The TON Storage Daemon introduces several novel concepts to facilitate efficient file distribution across the network. These include the “Bag of Files” (BoF), a unique data structure that encapsulates files for distribution, and the use of the TON Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for peer discovery. Furthermore, it employs advanced cryptographic methods to ensure data integrity and security throughout the distribution process.

### [](#operational-commands-and-usage-4)Operational Commands and Usage

The `storage-daemon-cli` serves as the command-line interface for managing the daemon, providing a suite of commands for adding, managing, and distributing Bags of Files. Users can start the daemon with customizable parameters to optimize performance based on their hardware and network capabilities. Additionally, the daemon supports partial downloads and file prioritization, allowing users to tailor the file-sharing process to their specific needs.

### [](#technical-specification-for-creating-and-distributing-files-5)Technical Specification for Creating and Distributing Files

Creating a Bag of Files involves specifying the target path and an optional description. The daemon automatically handles the encryption, chunking, and distribution of files, with users having the option to control upload settings and file priorities. The daemon’s integration with TON’s blockchain ensures that files are distributed securely and efficiently, with minimal overhead.

### [](#conclusion-6)Conclusion

The TON Storage Daemon marks a significant leap forward in decentralized file sharing, offering unparalleled security, efficiency, and flexibility. Its integration with TON’s blockchain technologies paves the way for a new era of file distribution, free from the constraints of traditional centralized systems. By providing detailed technical specifications and user-friendly operational commands, the TON Storage Daemon stands poised to revolutionize how data is shared across the digital landscape.
