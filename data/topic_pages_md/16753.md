So @league has just airdroped another 120 thousand toncoins to imaginary eligible people (around 1800 people)  
Who are this guys???  
I surely am one of the active members so far… And I and many other people always get denied.  
Wtf!!! Is going on???

And in the other hand there are some people who confuse that they did nothing but they got fat piece of the cake.  
WTF!!! IS GOING ON???

If you weren’t eligible, it doesn’t mean they scammed you.
