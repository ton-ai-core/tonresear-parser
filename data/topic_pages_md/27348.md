    **[$MIXER Bridge Telegram Bot](https://t.me/ton_mix_bot) is a cross chain utility service, allowing users to easily bridge funds between any of the 30+ chains we offer, right within Telegram! Our special utility is anonymous same-chain transfers. This enables users to send funds between wallets on the same chain without a direct transaction, hiding the sender wallet from the receiving address. For all developers we offer an api to integrate our bridge services within your own software!**

    **$MIXER is revoked and the initial LP is burnt. Community members have contributed to LP and one large holder has locked their share until February 2025!**

The team all bought on the market and was brought together based on their whale status, as the project was developing, the solo dev holds 0.3% left in their deployer wallet.**

Hello team,

Thank you for taking the time to apply for The Open League.

After a thorough review, we must inform you that, unfortunately, your project does not meet our current eligibility criteria. You can find them through this link: [About the Token Battle category](https://tonresear.ch/t/about-the-token-battle-category/1274)

Once your project aligns with these criteria, please feel free to resubmit your application for the future seasons.

We look forward to seeing your application again in the future.

Thank you.
