Hello, I am a student and I have been struggling with a lot of problems recently. I am asking the Ton Coin blockchain community to give me $10,000 in prize money or NFT to start my first business and share my ideas. This grace and forgiveness is only possible with the help of Ton coin community and I hope it will help me ![:slight_smile:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12 ":slight_smile:")
