Partnership Announcements

This month has been monumental for PsyDuck as we successfully connected with six exceptional partners, each bringing unique value to our community and game development. These collabs have led to more than 18 task exchanges and have rewarded our community with millions of feathers. These partnerships are set to elevate the Quack-Quack experience and provide our players with unparalleled opportunities and enhancements.

What’s next?

We’ve got big plans to expand PsyDuck beyond just a game—it’s all about evolving into a full-fledged ecosystem on the TON blockchain. We’re looking at adding new mini-games, enhanced PvP features, and even more ways for players to earn rewards.

Plus, our ultimate goal is to become a major publisher on TON, which means you can expect even bigger collaborations, community-driven content, and more innovative ways to engage. We’re just getting started, and the best is yet to come!
