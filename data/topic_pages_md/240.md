## [](#introduction-1)Introduction

The TON (The Open Network) blockchain has introduced an innovative mechanism to strengthen its ecosystem and tokenomics through the TON Believers Fund, also known as The Locker. This initiative encourages users to lock their Toncoin (TON) into a dedicated smart contract, aiming to reduce circulating supply, enhance token stability, and reward long-term commitment.
