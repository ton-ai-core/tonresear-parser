Following our ongoing assessment of bonding curve memepads on the TON mainnet and in line with our **eligibility criteria**, we are thrilled to announce that **Blum** has been selected as the next grantee in the TON Memelandia Grant Program.

Blum has finally rolled out their memepad to an impressive 87 million total users, with 35.5 million monthly active users (MAU)!

Features: secure minting, token performance dashboard and marketplace trading.

In just a few days since the initial app rollout, Blum has managed to meet the eligibility criteria and secure a $500,000 grant. It has thus become the fourth participant of the TON Memelandiaâ€™s grant program for memepads!

**How Can Other Memepads Apply?**

Any memepad that meets the eligibility criteria can apply to the Grant Program. The initiative is ongoing and accepts new submissions continuously.
