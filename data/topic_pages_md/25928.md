Rebalancing and profitability in liquidity pools ![:chart_with_upwards_trend:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/chart_with_upwards_trend.png?v=12 ":chart_with_upwards_trend:")  
The main idea of our project is that we create many pools with our REBA token, and rebalancing takes place between them through a special mechanism

REBA Contract: EQBYk9Rp8jgFmxE6XIIOiPJSxObAwt6DdThRdTP7t3JQhcTz

Rebalancing is when the price of one asset changes in pools relative to another, and then it is leveled by selling in one pool and buying in another

For each such transaction, commissions go to pools, so they grow in volume and in the amount of liquidity

Now we have 51 pools, we plan to create 100 poods in the next 3-6 months, that is, by the end of 2024

The rebalancing mechanism itself does not allow the price to rise or fall sharply. With any large sale or purchase, a rebalance occurs: a purchase in one pool is followed by a purchase in others and a sale in the first, the price is leveled. This is what can be seen in the history of operations, you can see under the chart:

After each purchase or sale, there is a rebalancing, that is, a counter purchase or sale with our other pools

Now we are entering into new partnerships, increasing liquidity, and bringing our idea to the TON community.

New projects are already coming to us to conclude cooperation, that is, to create a pool with us, and we do not take everything.

Now we did x500 from start, we started silently

Also, one of the important stages of the growth of our project will be the rebalancing of volumes in the liquidity pools. For example, in one pool, the token increased relative to REBA, and in the second it fell in price. We manually rebalance the volume in the pools, thereby ensuring the build-up of funds in the pools in the long term

There is also a burning clause in the roadmap: at various events, we plan to burn REBA, reducing its supply.

Thanks for support!
