Hello team,

Thank you for taking the time to apply for The Open League.

After a thorough review, we must inform you that, unfortunately, your NFT collection does not meet our current eligibility criteria. You can find these criteria through this link [About the NFT Battle category](https://tonresear.ch/t/about-the-nft-battle-category/20070)

Once the criteria are met from your side, please feel free to resubmit your application for the future seasons.

We look forward to seeing your application again in the future.

Thank you!
