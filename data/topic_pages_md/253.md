## [](#introduction-1)Introduction

This technical documentation presents a comprehensive performance comparison of the TON Blockchain against other leading networks. The analysis focuses on transaction throughput, scalability, and network configuration, highlighting TON’s innovative approach to achieving high transaction per second (TPS) rates.

## [](#ton-blockchain-performance-overview-2)TON Blockchain Performance Overview

The TON Blockchain recently demonstrated remarkable performance in a series of tests, showcasing its potential to outpace traditional blockchains and centralized payment systems. With a confirmed TPS rate of 104,715 on a network configured with 256 validators and 512 shardchains, TON sets a new standard for transaction processing capacity.

### [](#technical-details-6)Technical Details

A detailed examination of TON’s test configuration reveals the use of `ecs.c6.6xlarge` instances on Alibaba Cloud, running on an Ubuntu-based environment. The testnet’s architecture was specifically designed to demonstrate TON’s “Accelerator” update, which includes performance optimizations and feature enhancements.

A unique smart contract was deployed to generate transactional load across the network, simulating real-world usage at scale. The source code for this contract is available for review and further development.

## [](#conclusion-7)Conclusion

TON’s public test showcased not only a groundbreaking TPS rate but also the underlying robustness and adaptability of its network architecture. With TON’s dynamic sharding mechanism and the potential for millions of transactions per second, it represents a significant leap forward in blockchain technology, ready for mass adoption and capable of handling the transactional demands of the future.

# TON Performance Test

On October 31, we proved that TON is the fastest and most scalable blockchain in the world.

During public performance testing on **256** validator nodes, a speed of **104 715** transactions of smart contract execution per second was set. CertiK, the Web3's leading auditor, participated in the event as an independent party and confirmed the results.

The most impressive thing is that the result is far from the limit. TON can handle millions of transactions per second if there are enough validator nodes in the network.
