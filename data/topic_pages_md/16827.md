NOTNOT is a a memecoin ingeniously crafted to complement the Notcoin venture, residing on the TON blockchain. Proudly asserting their position as early adopters on the TON chain, the Not Notcoin team distinguishes themselves by avoiding the monotonous landscape of founder‚Äôs pet tokens. We are also the number 1 support token of Notcoin and are as a result probably not nothing.

NotNot aims to complement both Ton and Notcoin ecosystems with its upcoming utilities that include the introduction of the very own NFT‚Äôs called NOTBOTS, an own tapping game, which will likely contribute to bringing more people to TON as it‚Äôs inspired by the very famous game ‚Äúguitar hero‚Äù and you will be able to tap and earn $NOT. NOTNOT also is set to introduce the possibility to stake $NOTNOT in order to earn $NOT. Furthermore $NOTNOT is embarking on a collaborative journey with its community to create an EVM-compatible version of the TON blockchain.
