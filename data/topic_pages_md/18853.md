Absolutely, the address of a smart contract in the TON blockchain remains unchanged after sharding. Sharding is designed to scale the network by dividing it into shardchains, but it doesn’t alter the unique addresses of smart contracts. These addresses are composed of a workchain ID and an intra-workchain address, ensuring consistency across the network’s structure.

For a deeper dive into TON’s sharding mechanisms, check out these resources:

When deploying a smart contract, its address can be pre-calculated, allowing it to receive funds and messages even before it’s activated. Activation is simply the process of deploying the contract with a deploy message. Learn more about smart contract deployment and address activation here:
