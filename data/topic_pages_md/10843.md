Community can vote twice a day by connecting their TON Wallet and signing a tx

And the project with highest vote gets our spotlight banned spot free for two days

I have seen this from Day 2. The team has a professional well thought approach with the RECA meme brand. They want to support ton ecosystem within Telegram by creating app which will help first time users onboard into Crypto World through Ton Blockchain

Hello Resistance Cat team,

Thank you for taking the time to apply for The Open League Season #1.

After a thorough review, we must inform you that, unfortunately, your token does not meet our current eligibility criteria. You can find them through this [link](https://tonresear.ch/t/about-the-memecoin-leaderboard-category/1276).

Once your token aligns with these criteria, please feel free to resubmit your application for the future seasons.

We look forward to seeing your application again in the future.

Thank you.
