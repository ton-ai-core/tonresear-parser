While TON Foundation is a more familiar name, few know the story of its early contributors—the **NEWTON team (TON Core Team).**

> Through voluntary technical contributions, NEWTON earned recognition from  
> [@Telegram](https://x.com/@Telegram)’s official team in 2021, leading to the technical handover that marked the greatest “Community Takeover” in blockchain history.

As an early member of NEWTON, let me share this story. ![:writing_hand:t2:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/writing_hand/2.png?v=12 ":writing_hand:t2:")

## [](#p-67291-introduction-joining-the-newton-team-and-its-mission-1)Introduction: Joining the NEWTON Team and Its Mission

When I joined the NEWTON team, our primary mission was clear: maintain the stability of the TON testnet2 code while enhancing developer tools.

Since we didn’t have direct control over the [ton-blockchain GitHub repository](https://github.com/ton-blockchain), we created a new organization called [NEWTON](https://github.com/newton-blockchain).  
To ensure smooth network updates, we encouraged the community to use NEWTON-developed validators as the standard version.

Between our founding and June 2021, the NEWTON Team accomplished several groundbreaking developments and infrastructure projects. Let’s dive into **10 critical contributions** that shaped TON’s early days.

## [](#p-67291-h-1-mytonctrl-automated-node-management-tool-2)1\. mytonctrl: Automated Node Management Tool

Our first major contribution was **mytonctrl**, a powerful automation tool for node installation and validator setup.

Features included:

*   Wallet creation
*   Contract deployment
*   Transaction history retrieval
*   DNS registration system (distinct from the modern NFT-packaged DNS)

Additionally, **mytonctrl** could configure validators, liteservers, and liteclients, simplifying node data access and parsing.

By 2021, we added CPU-based mining scripts and automated power tests to facilitate [$TON](https://x.com/search?q=%24TON&src=cashtag_click) mining.

## [](#p-67291-h-2-tonmon-visualizing-blockchain-health-3)2\. tonmon: Visualizing Blockchain Health

We created [tonmon](https://tonmon.xyz/) to monitor blockchain health.  
Key metrics included:

*   Block creation times
*   Shard statuses
*   dPoS election schedules
*   Validator counts and weights

> In the early days, the network had only ~80 validators globally.

## [](#p-67291-h-3-tonmine-monitoring-giver-contracts-4)3\. tonmine: Monitoring Giver Contracts

[tonmine](https://tonmine.xyz/) tracked TON mining activity.  
By 2021, only ten small givers remained, distributing ~200,000 [$TON](https://x.com/search?q=%24TON&src=cashtag_click) daily across all contracts.

> Mining difficulty varied significantly depending on the giver.

## [](#p-67291-h-4-cross-chain-bridge-5)4\. Cross-Chain Bridge

Before jetton or NFT standards, we developed a **native [$TON](https://x.com/search?q=%24TON&src=cashtag_click) bridge** for ERC-20 tokens on EVM-compatible chains.  
This enabled seamless transfers between TON, Ethereum, and BSC via [bridge.ton.org](https://bridge.ton.org/).

## [](#p-67291-h-5-cryptobothttpsxcomcryptobot-telegram-bot-wallet-6)5\. [@cryptobot](https://x.com/@cryptobot): Telegram Bot Wallet

In 2021, we developed [@cryptobot](https://x.com/@cryptobot), a Telegram wallet supporting:

*   [$BTC](https://x.com/search?q=%24BTC&src=cashtag_click)
*   [$TON](https://x.com/search?q=%24TON&src=cashtag_click)
*   [$BNB](https://x.com/search?q=%24BNB&src=cashtag_click)
*   [$USDT](https://x.com/search?q=%24USDT&src=cashtag_click)

## [](#p-67291-h-6-toncenter-simplifying-blockchain-data-access-7)6\. toncenter: Simplifying Blockchain Data Access

[toncenter](https://toncenter.com/) provided public APIs for developers, removing the need to set up full nodes or worry about serialized data formats.

> toncenter paved the way for modern APIs like [tonxapi.com](https://tonxapi.com/).

## [](#p-67291-h-7-explorertoncoinorg-tons-first-blockchain-explorer-8)7\. [explorer.toncoin.org](http://explorer.toncoin.org): TON’s First Blockchain Explorer

The first blockchain explorer built into TON’s core codebase was incredibly fast but too technical for most users.

## [](#p-67291-h-8-tonsh-a-new-generation-explorer-9)8\. ton.sh: A New Generation Explorer

We created [ton.sh](http://ton.sh/) to address usability challenges. Key features included wallet balances, transactions, and memos.

## [](#p-67291-h-9-tonweb-the-essential-javascript-sdk-10)9\. TonWeb: The Essential JavaScript SDK

We developed **TonWeb**, a JavaScript SDK simplifying wallet creation, deployment, and transactions.

## [](#p-67291-h-10-ton-wallet-my-first-ton-wallet-11)10\. ton wallet: My First TON Wallet

This was my first TON wallet, and it’s still functional today.

## [](#p-67291-recognition-newtons-open-letter-to-telegram-12)Recognition: NEWTON’s Open Letter to Telegram

By June 2021, the NEWTON team documented its contributions in an open letter ([TIP-33](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TIPs/issues/33)).  
To our surprise, [@Telegram](https://x.com/@Telegram)’s official team replied on June 30, 2021, marking the start of a new era.
