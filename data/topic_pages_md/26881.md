How ![:fuelpump:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/fuelpump.png?v=12 ":fuelpump:") GasPump works:

1.  Any user can create a token for **0.3 TON** in less than **2 minutes**. All that’s needed are: an image, a name, and a $TICKER.
    
2.  Token **instantly** becomes tradable using a bonding curve algorithm (the earlier you buy – the lower the price, the later you buy – the higher the price). The token creator has **the right to the first purchase** at the lowest price. This is their **only (!)** privilege compared to other buyers. If the token you created is not bought by anyone, you can always sell it and get back all the invested TON (excluding a small fee).
    
3.  When the token’s market capitalization reaches ~$20K (equivalent to gathering 1000 TON), all the collected liquidity is **automatically** sent to DeDust to reach new heights. LP tokens are **burned**.
    

The token creator cannot **scam** or **rug-pull** you because the entire process is transparent and governed by bullet-proof smart contracts. ![:fuelpump:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/fuelpump.png?v=12 ":fuelpump:") GasPump is the **only way** to fairly and safely launch a TON token.

And the cherry ![:cherries:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/cherries.png?v=12 ":cherries:") on top: after creating or buying the token, you receive an automatically generated **sticker pack** with the token’s image for easy shilling!
