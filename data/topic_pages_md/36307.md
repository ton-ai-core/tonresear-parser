Hello everyone, I’m [Sasha](https://t.me/zwiak) from [Youhold](https://t.me/youhold) \[[RU](https://t.me/youhold_ru)\]. I’m looking for partnerships with start-up mini-apps with open faces and confident plans. I’ll add the first 2-3 such startups to the YouHold startups section, without any conditions (if you want, you can also write a post about the partnership), while we’re small.

**About us:**

[Youhold](https://t.me/youhold) determines whether you have any tokens/pools/farms from the list on your balance, as well as whether you participate in other startup miners/games/clickers (will be added later) from the list, and determines the total speed of mining our tokens.

If you do not have any assets yet, you can still start mining on bonuses that are earned inside the mini-application.

From 12.09.2024, the development of the second tool begins: a game that has never been and is not available in Telegram. The development will take 1-2 months, active users with sufficient balances will get access to the beta test, the participation of such early users will be rewarded. The game will be in the mini-application itself, it has its own separate roadmap with a transition to on-chain. As the project develops, the complexity of mining our tokens will increase.

— Each house has 100 floors with increasing difficulty and chances to get a card, there is a boss on every 10th floor, after each boss the progress is saved, and the collected assets are transferred to the permanent balance;  
— you cannot return to the stage earlier than the previous save or reset the passage, if you get stuck, save up UH for bottles and then take into account your previous experience, read the chat, there are tips and screenshots / videos of other participants;  
— each next house is more difficult by ~ 1%;  
— you can choose a hero to complete the house only on floor 0 at the very beginning of each house;  
— 10 gray cards of one character in your deck turn into 1 bronze card of this character, 10 bronze into 1 silver, 10 silver into 1 gold;  
— any cards increase the airdrop relative to their grade and quantity;  
— for a gold card you can buy a city on the world map, and later get an NFT confirming ownership with the possibility of resale;  
— cards of different grades accordingly reduce fees for UH transfers in chat, see the profile section in the app;
