Hello, I’m a full stack developer, I made tontip, a tip plugin for bloggers. If you are reading a good blog post, will you tip the writer through the TonTip plugin?

Hey!  
I guess it’s a great option for content creators to receive their tips. However, I wonder, how you would compete with Telegram Stars system.

It’s my first time heard of Telegram stars, thans for the information. I think the differences are:

1.  Stars are used to pay for product, but blog content is not a product, readers can tip at will.
2.  TipTon is a js plugin, you can embed it in any website, not restricted in telegram mini app
