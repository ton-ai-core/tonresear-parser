In the evolving landscape of blockchain technology, the TON Blockchain stands at the forefront of innovation and security. The latest governance contract audit, conducted by Certik, has revealed no critical issues necessitating immediate upgrades. However, anticipating future needs for new functionalities, we have proactively addressed all findings from Certik. This document serves as a technical brief on the current state and future directions for TON governance contracts, detailing the enhancements and proposed changes in a structured format.
