![:moneybag:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/moneybag.png?v=12 ":moneybag:") Airdrop for Holders: Until the closed beta test starts, your goal is simply to hold NFT and $MIC tokens. We have allocated $4,000 and 41666 $MIC tokens for airdrop among NFT holders. Starting from the moment all NFTs are minted, we will be replenishing the award pool. This is your chance to earn passive income just for holding NFTs.

![:chart_with_upwards_trend:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/chart_with_upwards_trend.png?v=12 ":chart_with_upwards_trend:") Passive income from NFTs: In the attributes of each NFT there is a margin percentage of 5% to 40% depending on the rarity of the NFT. If an NFT has copies, the income is shared among all holders of those copies. This creates an incentive to exchange and crossbreed NFTs among participants to increase the rarity and thus the percentage of income.

![:twisted_rightwards_arrows:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/twisted_rightwards_arrows.png?v=12 ":twisted_rightwards_arrows:") Crossbreeding NFTs: Increase the rarity of your NFTs by crossbreeding them. This not only increases your passive income, but also allows you to create a monopoly on a certain type of item. When you crossbreed, the income from the original model is distributed among the new copies, increasing your share of the overall pool.
