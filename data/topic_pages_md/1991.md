## [](#describe-the-mechanism-of-providing-liquidity-on-your-platform-5)Describe the mechanism of providing liquidity on your platform:

To begin with injecting liquidity into this Project,  
**Step 1:** The Ownership Coin platform introduces a unique approach for $OC MiningBot minting (as NFT), where every new user must acquire 1 $OC token from an existing miner. This system ensures a self-sustaining liquidity ecosystem, as the influx of new miners necessitates the purchase of $OC tokens from current participants. This model not only incentivizes early mining efforts but also fosters a continuously expanding liquidity pool, enhancing the ecosystem’s vibrancy and stability as the user base grows.

**Step 2:** The OC Project will roll out a world-wide Mining Speed (MS) Competition in 3 categories (3 Hour | 6 Hours | 12 Hours) as the world wide awareness campaign for the $OC and to grow the organise user base.

**Step 3** We will then introduce the first use case of the $OC by launching :
