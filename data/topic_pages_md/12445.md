Paper $PLANE is a memecoin based on the historic moment when Russia tried to ban Telegram in 2018 and Pavel Durov called on everyone to throw paper planes as a sign of resistance.

A paper plane is also associated with the iconic Telegram logo. Although $PLANE has no association with Telegram, the $PLANE logo is a mix of the old Telegram logo created in 2013 fused with the most current Telegram logo created in 2019.

Not only is $PLANE a memecoin with a timeless narrative, $PLANE has developed an addictive game playable directly as a Telegram app. This game has been used to bring awareness to the TON ecosystem by forging collaborations with other projects on TON.

Paper planes are timeless and know no boundaries as they fly free and effortlessly, or better yet, as the founder of Telegram says,  
“The original meaning of the paper plane on the Telegram logo means freedom.”  
\-Pavel Durov

As of April 22nd, the $PLANE metrics are

*   $6.70 million FDV
*   $232k TVL
*   3020 Holders
*   $180k daily volume
*   3 month old project
