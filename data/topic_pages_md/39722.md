Following the first assessment round of the existing bonding curve memepads on TON mainnet and their on-chain metrics and taking into account the **eligibility criteria**, several grantees have been chosen to join the first cohort:

1.  [TON Pump by HOT Wallet](https://t.me/herewalletbot/app?startapp=hotpump)
2.  [BigPump by PocketFi](https://t.me/pocketfi_bot/bigpump?startapp=terror240_8242)
3.  [GasPump](https://t.me/gaspump_bot)

The first cohort of grantees is aimed as a test and will be scaled further.

Any other eligible memepad can apply for a grant at ANY time using [THIS FORM.](https://forms.gle/RtQfi5QXvJbBLycq9)

Grant size per each Grantee: $500,000

Next steps

*   Individual KPIs will be set for each Grantee;
*   Each Grantee will receive the grant amount in the upcoming period;
*   Grantees are required to present bi-weekly reports on TONResearch with the progress with their key metrics;
*   After 4 weeks of grant exploration since the receipt of the grant amount, the above-set KPIs will be checked and assessed;
*   A fully-pledged framework for KPI setting and assessment will be released after the first cohort to scale the program further.

How can other memepads apply?

Any other memepad that complies with the eligibility criteria can apply to this Grant Program. The initiative is ongoing and accepts new submission without breaks.
