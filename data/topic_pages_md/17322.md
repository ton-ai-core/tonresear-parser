Shitcoin ($SHIT) / TON memecoin

Shitcoin! A cryptocurrency with little to no value or a digital currency that has no immediate discernible purpose.

Shitcoin trading has already become a meme. Why shitcoins so attractive? Constant threats of ragpools, huge volatility, teams constantly disappearing into oblivion. Despite all this problems traders monitor screeners in hope. They want the Chosen One. Lowcap give them hope for a wife-change money in case the coin will make it.

‚ÄúThe one‚Äù is already here. We made one shitcoin to rule them all. If you want to buy a shitcoin you no longer have to choose which one. Shitcoin is here.

$shitcoin was created in order to gather a strong community around itself and generate as many memes as possible as soon as possible.

Tokenomics:  
45% - presale  
27% - DEX-liquidity  
18% - boosters for pools, marketing and CEX-liquidity  
10% - team and community rewards.

Roadmap:  
Presale (+)  
Launch $shitcoin (+)  
Stonfi and Dedust pools (+)  
Bonus-campaign  
NFT-collection  
CEX  
Shitcoin Screener  
Shitcoin Game.
