*   **Token Name**: NOVA
    
*   **Project’s Twitter**: [@dragunovaton](https://x.com/dragunovaton)
    
*   **Please describe your project and token utility**:  
    [Dragunova Trading Bot](https://t.me/dragunovaton) is a fast, secure trading bot built directly into Telegram. The project was born and raised in the Telegram and TON ecosystems, catering to crypto traders, built by crypto traders. Modeled after the sharpshooter precision of the Dragunov sniper rifle, NOVA is your expert in executing market moves with unparalleled accuracy and speed. We’ve recently gone live with our own private node in order to provide the fastest possible trading on the TON Blockchain. The development team is currently working on a list of new features to ship to users including, but not limited to; limit orders, sniping, Gaspump/Wonton integration and revenue sharing. NOVA token holders will be entitled to 40% of all trading fees generated by the bot. While not a token utility specifically, it’s worth noting that users can also receive an additional 30% of trading fees from referred users via our Referral System.
    
*   **Please provide detailed information on your token distribution, especially indicating the % of token supply held by the team and the status of the team’s LP tokens:**  
    The NOVA token contract is revoked and the initial LP has been recently re-locked. Community members have contributed to our token liquidity, particularly around our recent promotion with [ston.fi](http://ston.fi) which included boosted rewards for participants [https://t.me/stonfidex/624](https://t.me/stonfidex/624)  
    We did not conduct a presale, ICO or anything of that nature. NOVA was a stealth launch without advertisement and the community has organically bought and holds about 65% of the supply. [23% was burned after launch](https://tonviewer.com/EQCPIijcaVHuuaPLtuCtiD0mwueZG73beHJ5vdV_l9_vzv5_?section=holders), with 10% set aside for marketing and future liquidity provisions, of which [6.965% remains](https://tonviewer.com/UQClzmpo21bKwgdlzRKVxVcrI_IBg6XWXz1sJkD_gt3UNUYu) and [4.2% currently rests in the ston.fi pool](https://tonviewer.com/EQCPIijcaVHuuaPLtuCtiD0mwueZG73beHJ5vdV_l9_vzv5_?section=holders).
    
*   **CA**: EQCPIijcaVHuuaPLtuCtiD0mwueZG73beHJ5vdV\_l9\_vzv5\_
    
*   **LP**: EQAQ\_iIhPd6eTJYOq6KrqZEksp85WYc7sQM6d0jgX0xOqtrA
    
*   **Please describe your project roadmap for the next 6-12 months:**  
    As mentioned above, our development team is currently working to ship the community’s most sought-after features in the safest and most secure manner possible. While our intention is to provide the fastest trade execution on the TON Blockchain, our highest priority has been, and always will be, safety and security. Bot features most likely to be rolled out to Dragunova users in the next 6-12 months include limit orders, new launch sniping, liquidity listening, Gaspump/Wonton integration and revenue sharing. To help achieve our goals, we are currently working to expand our development team from 4 (1 full-time and 3 part-time) devs to 10 (3 full-time and 7+ part-time). Additionally, as broader TON Ecosystem attention rises we will begin to put our [~3000 TON Treasury](https://tonviewer.com/UQBoknzDD3eqq-vVm09G38VjMp0PM-an5XMFLhU4R5vMXELI) to work on marketing and partnerships.

*   **Do you consider your token a memecoin so that the ‘meme’ label can be added next to your ticker in the leaderboard if your application is approved?:**  
    While we’re not a memecoin, we have recently introduced our lovable (and very meme-able) mascot, Casanova. He brings a fantastic branding opportunity as well as what we believe to be some of the best stickers on Telegram.
