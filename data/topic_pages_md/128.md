### [](#introduction-1)Introduction

Archive Nodes play a pivotal role in blockchain ecosystems, particularly for applications that necessitate access to comprehensive historical data. This guide provides a detailed walkthrough on setting up and operating an Archive Node on the TON Blockchain, designed for developers and operators of blockchain explorers or services requiring extensive historical records.

### [](#system-requirements-and-prerequisites-2)System Requirements and Prerequisites

Before initiating the setup process, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

*   **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 22.04, or Debian 11.
    
*   **User Privileges**: A non-root user with sudo privileges.
    
*   **Hardware Specifications**:
    
    Component
    
    Specification
    
    CPU
    
    16 Cores
    
    Memory
    
    128GB ECC
    
    Storage
    
    4TB SSD or Provisioned 32+k IOPS
    
    Network
    
    1 Gbit/s Connectivity
    
    Traffic
    
    16 TB/month on peak
    
    Additional
    
    Fixed Public IP Address
    

_Note: The 4TB storage recommendation assumes the use of a ZFS volume with compression enabled._

### [](#installation-steps-3)Installation Steps

#### [](#h-1-install-zfs-and-prepare-the-volume-4)1\. Install ZFS and Prepare the Volume

The Archive Node data is provided in the form of ZFS Snapshots, requiring ZFS on your host system. Install ZFS and create a dedicated pool on a 4TB disk named `data`. Enabling compression on the ZFS filesystem (`lz4`) is recommended to optimize storage usage.

Commands:

```
sudo apt install zfsutils-linux
sudo zpool create data <disk>
sudo zfs set compression=lz4 data
```

#### [](#h-2-install-mytonctrl-5)2\. Install MyTonCtrl

Follow the instructions provided in the Running Full Node guide to install MyTonCtrl on your system.

#### [](#h-3-download-and-restore-the-dump-data-6)3\. Download and Restore the Dump Data

Obtain access credentials from the [@TONBaseChatEn](https://t.me/TONBaseChatEn) Telegram chat, then use the following command to download and restore the dump data from [https://archival-dump.ton.org](https://archival-dump.ton.org):

```
wget --user <usr> --password <pwd> -c https://archival-dump.ton.org/dumps/latest.zfs.lz | pv | plzip -d -n <cores> | zfs recv data/ton-work
```

Replace `<usr>` and `<pwd>` with your credentials, and adjust `<cores>` to match your CPU’s capabilities for optimal extraction speed.

#### [](#h-4-configure-and-start-the-archive-node-7)4\. Configure and Start the Archive Node

After restoring the dump, ensure correct permissions are set for the `/var/ton-work` directory. Update the node configuration to specify storage settings for the Archive Node. Start the node with the following command:

```
systemctl start validator.service
```

Monitor the node’s synchronization process using MyTonCtrl’s `status` command.

### [](#node-maintenance-8)Node Maintenance

Regular maintenance is crucial for optimal Archive Node performance. This includes stopping the validator service, cleaning old logs, removing temporary files, and restarting the service. Commands for each step are detailed in the main guide.

### [](#troubleshooting-and-backups-9)Troubleshooting and Backups

In case of operational issues, you may roll back to a previous state using ZFS snapshots. Regularly snapshotting your filesystem is recommended for easy rollback and data integrity.

### [](#support-and-community-10)Support and Community

### [](#conclusion-11)Conclusion

Running an Archive Node on the TON Blockchain is a straightforward process with the right preparation and resources. This guide provides the necessary steps and best practices to ensure your node is set up correctly and maintained for optimal performance.

This guide aims to empower developers and operators with the knowledge and tools required to successfully deploy and manage an Archive Node on the TON Blockchain, ensuring access to valuable historical data for a wide range of applications.
