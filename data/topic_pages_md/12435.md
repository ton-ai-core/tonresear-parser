## [](#gemston-is-an-engagement-token-used-to-incentivize-active-participation-in-the-stonfi-protocol-2)GEMSTON is an engagement token used to incentivize active participation in the [STON.fi](http://STON.fi) protocol.

The GEMSTON tokens are funded to staker’s wallet in the form of fungible tokens on TON  
Blockchain and can be freely transferred, traded, or held at staker’s discretion.  
The number of GEMSTON that are rewarded is calculated according to the following equation:  
𝑌 = 𝑋 \* 𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑡, 𝑇) / 𝑇  
where 𝑋 is the amount of staked STON, 𝑡 is lock-up duration in seconds, 𝑇 is number of  
seconds in the 2-year period and 𝑌 is the amount of funded GEMSTON. So, the longer the  
lock-up period, the more rewards and voting power are provided.  
The supply of GEMSTON tokens is theoretically unlimited and [STON.fi](http://STON.fi) DAO is motivated to  
introduce various mechanics that permanently remove GEMSTON tokens from circulation and  
increase demand for these tokens.  
We deliberately don’t provide detailed description of possible use cases for GEMSTON tokens  
with a goal to engage the community in open discussion of GEMSTON utility
