In the domain of blockchain technology, multisignature (multisig) wallets serve as critical tools for enhancing security and flexibility in managing digital assets. The TON blockchain multisig contract, particularly in its original format, introduces specific functionalities and challenges that warrant detailed examination. Recent modifications to its FunC code and interaction scripts have aimed to address certain vulnerabilities and inefficiencies, making it imperative to understand these changes and their implications for users and developers.

This inquiry seeks to dissect and analyze the TON blockchain multisig contract, focusing on several key aspects:

1.  **Code Modifications and Their Rationale**: What specific changes were made to the original FunC code of the TON blockchain multisig contract, including the rationale behind these modifications, particularly regarding the additional checks for proposed queries and bug fixes?
2.  **Functional Overview of the (n, k)-Multisig Wallet**: Can you provide a detailed description of the (n, k)-multisig walletâ€™s functionality, including its unique features compared to other blockchain multisig wallets, such as the handling of orders with less than k signatures and the capability to control the wallet solely with keys?
3.  **Risk Assessment of Multisig Wallet Usage**: What are the risks associated with using the TON blockchain multisig wallet, particularly concerning the potential for out-of-gas credit exceptions due to excessive non-expired orders?
4.  **Compilation and Script Execution Procedures**: How should the multisig contract be compiled effectively, and what are the recommended practices for running the various scripts, such as new-key.fif, generate-keypairs.fif, and create-msg.fif, to ensure accurate and secure operations?
5.  **Order Creation and Signature Management**: What are the steps involved in creating a new order with create-order.fif script, adding signatures with add-signature.fif, and managing signature lists for ensuring the integrity and authenticity of orders?
6.  **External Message Creation and Order Processing**: How is the external message created using create-external-message.fif script, and what role does the private key play in this process? Additionally, what are the implications for order processing and execution within the multisig contract?
7.  **Tools for Signature and Order Verification**: What functionalities do scripts like clear-signatures.fif, show-signed-by.fif, show-msg.fif, and show-order.fif offer in terms of managing and verifying signatures and orders in the multisig contract?

This comprehensive analysis aims to explore the technical intricacies and improvements of the TON blockchain multisig contract, enhancing understanding for users and developers seeking to leverage its capabilities for secure and efficient digital asset management.
