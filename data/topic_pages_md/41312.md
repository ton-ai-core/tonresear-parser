# [](#p-68199-introduction-1)**Introduction**

In blockchain ecosystems, token airdrops serve as a common mechanism for token distribution and community engagement. However, traditional airdrop implementations face several significant challenges:

*   **High Transaction Costs**: Each airdrop recipient requires an individual minting transaction
*   **Network Scalability Issues**: Large-scale airdrops create network congestion
*   **Centralized Control Requirements**: Projects must maintain centralized distribution systems

These limitations create significant operational constraints for airdrop implementations, particularly for projects with large-scale user bases or limited resources.

# [](#p-68199-what-is-mintless-jetton-2)**What is Mintless Jetton?**

## [](#p-68199-solution-overview-3)**Solution Overview**

TON blockchain introduces Mintless Jetton, an innovative protocol that extends TEP-74 (TON Jettons Standard) through [TEP-177](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/pull/177) (Mintless Jettons Standard) and [TEP-176](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/pull/176) (Custom Payload Offchain Source for Jettons). The protocol enables efficient token distribution through Merkle proof verification, eliminating the need for individual minting transactions.

The protocol leverages cryptographic Merkle proofs to validate airdrop claims, significantly reducing operational costs while maintaining security and scalability.

## [](#p-68199-core-benefits-4)**Core Benefits**

*   **Cost Optimization**: Eliminates per-recipient minting transactions
*   **Enhanced Scalability**: Supports large-scale distributions without network congestion
*   **Cryptographic Security**: Implements tamper-proof claim verification via Merkle proofs with double-claim prevention
*   **Decentralized Architecture**: Removes dependency on centralized distribution systems

# [](#p-68199-technical-architecture-5)**Technical Architecture**

The Mintless Jetton protocol comprises two primary smart contracts and a Merkle tree verification system.

## [](#p-68199-core-contract-components-6)**Core Contract Components**

_**Jetton Minter Contract**_

*   Manages total token supply and minting operations
*   Stores Merkle root for airdrop verification
*   Handles administrative functions and contract upgrades
*   Maintains metadata URIs for Merkle dump and API endpoints

_**Jetton Wallet Contract**_

*   Manages individual user token balances
*   Processes token transfer operations
*   Implements airdrop verification and processing logic
*   Maintains wallet state (balance, owner address, and airdrop status)

System Flow for Mintless Jetton Airdrop Claim

The Jetton Minter contract functions as the master contract, deterministically deriving and managing multiple Jetton Wallet contracts. Each wallet maintains its own isolated state while sharing a common Merkle root for airdrop verification. This one-to-many architecture enables scalable token distribution and efficient transfer operations across the network.
