Hi I have been on TON the past year and there seems to be a big problem with bringing new investors on chain, I believe with Memelandia and the new audio tokens “Sadmeow” you should consider advertising the first season on crypto banter YouTube channel they have a very large audience of real investors and that’s what TON needs. Thanks
