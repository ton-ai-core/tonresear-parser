Everyone already knows that [@durov](/u/durov) himself said that #NFTs as stickers are the next goal in $TON.

But did you know that $CHERRY is the most popular sticker on the platform?

That’s because we’re the default sticker; Telegram reached the milestone of 900 million active users and everyone knows $CHERRY. You’re early, Anon.

Hello team,

Thank you for taking the time to apply for The Open League.

After a thorough review, we must inform you that, unfortunately, your project does not meet our current eligibility criteria. You can find them through this link: [About the Token & Memecoin Battle category](https://tonresear.ch/t/about-the-token-memecoin-battle-category/1274/)

Once your project aligns with these criteria, please feel free to resubmit your application for the future seasons.

We look forward to seeing your application again in the future.

Thank you.
