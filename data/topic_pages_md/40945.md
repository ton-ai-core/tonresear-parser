Have you ever felt embarrassed, cheated, or outsmarted? ![:sob:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/sob.png?v=12 ":sob:")![:sob:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/sob.png?v=12 ":sob:")![:sob:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/sob.png?v=12 ":sob:")

I know we’ve all experienced one or more of this as a fresher in a university or a newcomer in an unfamiliar environment.

As a university fresher, I got lost in my school building twice, relying on Google Maps as my lifesaver. I was also cheated by a bike man… If I continued sharing my struggles, this thread wouldn’t contain struggle I faced as a fresher.

However, I never realized how quickly I became familiar with my school until I encountered similar challenges in Web3. The struggles were the same, just disguised differently.

As I reflect on my experiences, I identify patterns of common challenges we all faced in an unfamiliar place, and also how I’ve solved them.

**1\. Lack of a Mentor or Guardian:**  
If I had a guardian who could have told me that the bike ride would cost 100 naira, I wouldn’t have lost an extra 400 naira to the bike man. Similarly, if I had a mentor when I first came into contact with Web3, I wouldn’t have lost $300 by holding onto a token when I should have taken profits.

**2\. Lack of Experience:**  
If you already have a guardian or mentor, gaining experience becomes much easier. Without one, you’re left to figure things out on your own, which often means getting lost, scammed, or wasting time before you can become smarter and more experienced.

**3\. Lack of Access to Relevant Information:**  
Another major problem is the difficulty in finding reliable information. This is where engagement and interaction come into play. By connecting with like-minded individuals, joining communities, and participating in Twitter Spaces, you can fast-track your learning and develop better techniques for gathering information.

This are the major problems I faced as a university freshman and a newbie in Web3
