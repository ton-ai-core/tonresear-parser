**TONPlanets Mars** - A browser-based economic simulator with an open world, incorporating several core gaming mechanics **M2E** , **P2E** , was launched in 2022. It represents an entire world with its alternative history, characters, storyline, and unique economic model, complemented by an in-game exchange where resource prices are determined based on supply and demand‚Ä¶

We are creating a game where you can learn spot trading in a safe environment. The genre of an economic simulator implies trading practice, which in a gaming format helps to acquire the basic concepts and principles of trading. The game teaches how to calculate the profitability of a business, taking into account depreciation of assets and production costs. Ultimately, thanks to the Martian environment, someone will be able to overcome their fears or insecurities and eventually become a successful trader.

$MARS Token:  
**Payment Instrument in the Game Panel:**

The token is an integral part of the game mechanics, serving as one of the payment instruments in the game panel.

**Trading on DEX and In-Game Exchange:**

The token is actively traded not only on the Decentralized Exchange (DEX) but also on the in-game exchange. This opens opportunities for players to participate in trading and strengthen their position in the game.

**Reward for Land Staking:**

The token also serves as a reward for land staking, incentivizing players to participate in this process and maintain the stability of the game ecosystem.

**Usage in DAO Voting:**

Additionally, the token is utilized in DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) voting processes, enabling players to have a say in the decision-making and governance of the game‚Äôs ecosystem.

## [](#please-describe-your-project-roadmap-for-the-next-6-12-months-3)Please describe your project roadmap for the next 6-12 months

The gaming potential has only been unleashed by 10% so far. We have a multitude of new production facilities with their unique resource chains ahead of us. In the near future, both produced and rare mineral resources, which are not yet utilized in the game, will be incorporated into the gameplay.

The Martian DEX screener, recognized by many TON blockchain users, continues to evolve. New features and opportunities are on the horizon, expanding its functionality.
