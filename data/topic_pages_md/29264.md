We are committed to building trust, being willing to offer help to others, bringing hope to society, and encouraging people not to lose faith in life or feel disappointed in the world. We treat everyone with sincerity because we hope to bring hope to everyone. We will not force anyone to believe in us, nor will we ask you to do anything you are unwilling to do. We have created a game and hope to build a strong community through it to help more people in need. This is the significance of SEED‚Äôs existence, and your participation will be our greatest hope at present, while helping you will always be our hope. Finally, we wish you all have fun playing, and we will always be by your side, growing continuously, and bringing you hope.
