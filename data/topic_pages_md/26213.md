Hello team,

Thank you for taking the time to apply for The Open League.

After a thorough review, we must inform you that, unfortunately, your application does not meet our current eligibility criteria. You can find these criteria through this link: [About the App Battle category](https://tonresear.ch/t/about-the-app-battle-category/1275)

The application does not contain an essential document with information about SMC and SDK

We look forward to seeing your application again in the future.

Thank you!
