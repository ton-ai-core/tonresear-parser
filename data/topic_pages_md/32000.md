## [](#p-49526-projects-message-2)Project’s Message

Currently, Bitcoin is no longer truly decentralized. It is largely held by investment funds, large  
economic organizations, and wealthy individuals. They use Bitcoin as a trump card to  
manipulate the entire cryptocurrency market and always find ways to take money from  
inexperienced and small investors; even those with many years of experience cannot  
escape this manipulation.

Bitcoin is no longer suitable as a means of payment for everyone because it is expensive, manipulated, slow.  
Why should the entire crypto market be dependent on and controlled by Bitcoin?

We, users, supporters, investors, crypto and blockchain developers, are tired of this and  
wish for a new cryptocurrency platform to replace Bitcoin.  
NOTBITCOIN is distributed for free to everyone, offering a new opportunity, a fresh breeze we  
want to bring to everyone, especially small investors who do not have money.
