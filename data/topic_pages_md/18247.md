swap.coffee is a project dedicated to creating a set of tools for working with tokens and NFTs on the TON platform based on a one-stop-shop principle. The platform allows for cross-chain OTC transactions, aggregates all liquidity in the TON blockchain, enables limit orders on AMM DEXs (soon) , DCA orders (soon), launching tokens, and conducting token sales (soon). Token holders receive income from the protocol’s profit.
