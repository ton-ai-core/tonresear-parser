## [](#token-ido-1)Token IDO

1.  Funds raised: We intended to raise 150-200k and actually raised 150,000 USDT on TonUP and 50,000 USDT on GoWrap, totally 200,000 USDT.
2.  Participants: Double confirmed, totally around 300 wallets, roughly half from TonUP and half from GoWrap, with nearly 50% of them bought a hard cap. And all these are sold in a few minutes, so hundreds failed to buy due to huge demand but limited supply.
