By far the best project on the Ton Network, and the most useful I’ve seen so far on any network. I use Crypton utilities daily - from trending to sniping to scanning to new contracts deployed - they are essential tools.

From an investor perspective - the revenue share is very attractive and the most solid chart I’ve seen in a long time (check the daily). This is my favourite project and my #1 long-term hold.

Congratulations Team Crypton!!!

At Friday 19 April, I book Crypton Trending 12h for my project. **[@CryptonTrendingBot](https://t.me/CryptonTrendingBot)**  
First I send 40 Ton but click View Tx too fast, It’s not accept and said Fail, because my Transaction is pending. The bot says, it will refund. After that my wallet -40 Ton trending is not active and Refund still don’t come back to my wallet.

Then, I book second time right after that, send another 40 Ton to book and it success.

I were waiting for refund for my first book, But it’s now Still don’t received anything from Cryton trending bot.

I find many way to contact for support but don’t see any channel to solve this issue, until now I am here.  
Please support me to get my refund.

My 2 Tx here: Please refund 1 tx (40 TON) to me. Thanks
