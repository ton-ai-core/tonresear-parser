Today, May 27, 2025, we at **Notbitcoin** proudly celebrate our first anniversary on the TON Blockchain. With a vision to build a simple and efficient peer-to-peer (P2P) payment ecosystem, as outlined in our whitepaper (notbitco.in/notbitcoin\_whitepaper\_v2.pdf), we have achieved significant milestones in our inaugural year. Through our **NBITPAY** application, detailed in our case study (notbitco.in/learn/casestudy), we have created a payment solution that serves the community, encourages idea contributions, and maintains transparency. Below are our key achievements in this journey.

## [](#p-68654-h-1-a-community-of-over-200000-users-on-telegram-mini-app-2)1\. A Community of Over 200,000 Users on Telegram Mini App

We have built a robust community with **over 200,000 miners** participating in the mining of our **$NBIT** token on the TON Blockchain. Our simple and accessible mining mechanism, integrated into the Telegram Mini App, enables everyone—from crypto enthusiasts to everyday users—to join the Notbitcoin ecosystem effortlessly. This milestone reflects our commitment to creating an open platform where the community is at the core and grows together.

## [](#p-68654-h-2-nbitpay-a-fee-free-high-speed-payment-application-3)2\. NBITPAY: A Fee-Free, High-Speed Payment Application

Our **NBITPAY** application, showcased in our case study (notbitco.in/learn/casestudy), exemplifies our efforts to simplify decentralized payments. With just a Telegram account and our **@nbitpaybot**, users can make transactions without creating a wallet, verifying bank accounts, or remembering complex passwords. To date, NBITPAY has processed **39,000 fee-free transactions**, each completed in just **0.01 seconds**, delivering a fast and cost-free payment experience. Many users have adopted NBITPAY QR codes in their stores to facilitate payments for goods and services, helping us build a growing payment community. We welcome ideas from the community to enhance NBITPAY, ensuring it meets real-world needs.

## [](#p-68654-h-3-developing-real-world-applications-for-nbit-through-partnerships-4)3\. Developing Real-World Applications for $NBIT Through Partnerships

We have developed **$NBIT** as a practical payment method, not only within the Notbitcoin ecosystem but also through partner projects. A prime example is **ClickHub**, a Telegram Mini App for affiliate marketing, where users can post affiliate links and offer $NBIT rewards for each click. This integration positions $NBIT as a tool for decentralized e-commerce and digital marketing, creating value for the community. We encourage our community to propose new use cases for $NBIT, from digital service payments to everyday transactions, to expand the token’s utility and deliver benefits to users.

## [](#p-68654-h-4-transparency-and-building-with-the-community-5)4\. Transparency and Building with the Community

At Notbitcoin, we place the community at the heart of every decision. Despite challenges such as delays in rolling out new features or updates, we remain transparent with our users about our progress and plans. We actively invite the community to contribute ideas, feedback, and suggestions to shape Notbitcoin’s future. Our vision, as outlined in our whitepaper, is to build a sustainable decentralized payment ecosystem where everyone can participate, contribute, use, and benefit. This transparency and collaborative spirit form the foundation of every product we develop, from NBITPAY to future features.

## [](#p-68654-conclusion-6)Conclusion

In our first year, we at **Notbitcoin** have achieved remarkable results: attracting **over 200,000 miners**, processing **39,000 fee-free transactions** on **NBITPAY** with a speed of **0.01 seconds**, and integrating **$NBIT** into practical applications like ClickHub. With a focus on building products for the community, we welcome ideas and feedback to improve our ecosystem while maintaining transparency at every step. Supported by the Telegram Mini App and TON Blockchain, along with the vision outlined in our whitepaper, we will continue to grow alongside our community, striving for a future of efficient and accessible decentralized payments worldwide.

While we have made significant strides, we recognize that becoming a globally adopted decentralized payment network is a long and challenging journey. With limited financial resources due to our decision not to raise external funding, we still have many areas to improve and refine over time. We sincerely hope for the community’s continued support, understanding, and contributions as we work to overcome these limitations and build a stronger, more sustainable Notbitcoin ecosystem.
