ALL HOLDERS receive airdrops in MARGA every two weeks from our company’s income. We are engaged in mining and investing in offline businesses.  
Airdrop amount depends on the rarity of NFTs. Each NFT gives a specific amount of MARGA to its owner every 2 weeks.  
Our holders already got $250k+ in AirDrops.
