## [](#metrics-5)Metrics

Our service, focusing on social media promotion, does not incorporate a DeFi (Decentralized Finance) mechanism, and therefore, does not have a Total Value Locked (TVL) metric. As our platform operates primarily on social media marketing and promotion, the concept of TVL, which is prevalent in DeFi platforms to represent the total capital held in their financial contracts, is not applicable to our service model.
