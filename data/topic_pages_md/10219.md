Meh is a community-driven token for those who don’t care about what others think. Originally a simple meme coin, it has now attracted a strong base of supporters, giving it the potential to expand further.

It’s important to note that as the founder, I was not given any pre-allocated tokens for myself; I bought them just like everyone else.
