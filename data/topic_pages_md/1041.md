not sure what’s with the link above, but it should lead to this page [https://getblock.io/nodes/ton/](https://getblock.io/nodes/ton/)  
Fell free to share your user id and I’ll add free RPC requests for testing

Nice! It’s good to hear about more and more RPC endpoint support in TON.

*   Is there any way we can expand or enable more data types or sources of on-chain data?
    
*   Is there a Telegram chat for developers who are having issues with the getBlock API, specifically for TON-related questions?
    

Also, here is my guide for RPC endpoints, feel free to add more:

Not sure I got your question, but we didn’t emerge as just another RPC endpoint in TON. We are an RPC endpoint FOR TON (a node provider)  
We have a discord channel where you can ask any TON related question in the dev chat or create a ticket and get an answer from out tech support.

Thank you for adding us to your provider list, we will announce that on our socials.
