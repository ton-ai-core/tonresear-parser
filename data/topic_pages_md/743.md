Good day, everyone! I would like to know your opinion on the supply of liquidity on DEX. I’ve been in TON for a long time and have met a lot of people who say that liquidity brings profit, and also people who think the opposite! What is your opinion on this? And what subtleties do you take into account when supplying liquidity? What do you pay attention to and how do you build the probability of success or failure?

hey. Liquidity is the optimum for long-term success. There is the saying “it’s the quantity that matters”. Mfg

It may be so, but how do you see the impact of the value of tokens on the final result of the liquidity pool?
