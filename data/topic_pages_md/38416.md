Hi everyone,

I’m currently taking part in TOL SS6 with a Normie Badge and had a few questions about the App League:

1.  Does interacting with the apps daily improve my Normie score?
2.  If not, does that mean I only need to interact with each app once?

I’ve been checking the leaderboard regularly, but my rank doesn’t seem to be improving. Any advice would be appreciated!

Thanks!

Interaction is good. Ton team has hinted this. Keep grinding, and interacting with the apps you trust. Support them all.
