*   Project’s Metrics  
    Crazy Rush Heroes,CRH, was launched on 24th July under TOWER Ecosystem; CRH is the flagship Telegram Mini App in the ecosystem which leveraged the IP of Crazy Defense Heroes which is the first P&E mobile tower defense game launched under TOWER Ecosystem back in 2021.
    

CRH aims to provide an action-tight and short-session gaming experience in Telegram so everyone can enjoy the dopamine rush in minutes. We got a 21K MAU organically on 18 August; a new ATH will come as we are continuously launching new features with quick agile roll-up. With the traction of the TON Open League Season 6, the growth will be tremendous. For more details visuals and metrics, please refer to the below Google Doc.
