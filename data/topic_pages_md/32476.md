*   Any other links or details that you want to share: We have conducted the community takeover over the original project on TON after developers decided to vanish. We got access to the collection wallet and managed to regain some part of the community. Also we managed to keep the floor price from going down to zero. We are going to give a new life to this project and release a p2e platform based on TG miniapps, including farming bot and different games with PvE and PvP modes. Also we are going to have an utilitary token that will be used to access our games. It can be gained only VIA our farming bot. The main gateway to our ecosystem is our farming bot paired with our NFT collection, that provides boosted token gain.  
    \-Farming bot is already in development stage.
