This project is SCAM. [ðŸ’Ž TONSquare Access Keys are LIVE NOW!](https://tonresear.ch/t/tonsquare-access-keys-are-live-now/18487)

They announced several partnerships, most of them are fake.  
CCA GROUP partner is not even on any social, totally unknown. I have been banned for asking infos about them.

Other 2 partners, their project is dead, asked them to prove partnership with TonSquare, they banned me from their Twitter (Avisa Games and CoinNerd).

TonSquare TG channel is the typical hype channel owned by bots and 2 silly moderators (Mohammed and Bruno), hyping each other while users asking for infos are muted or banned.

Beware, DO NOT BUY ACESS KEYS.

Look, when it comes to partnerships, itâ€™s pretty normal for projects to get some heat, especially from folks who just donâ€™t get it. CCA GROUP might not be blowing up on social media, but that doesnâ€™t mean theyâ€™re a scam. A lot of legit projects keep a low profile and still do big things. Just because you canâ€™t find every partner on social media doesnâ€™t mean theyâ€™re fake or whatever.

Getting banned for asking questions? Thatâ€™s just how it is in any community, man. They gotta keep things running smoothly and focus on what matters. If people are just spreading negativity without any proof, it totally messes up the vibe tho

Haha, right? Itâ€™s wild how some KOLs will throw shade but still jump on the bandwagon with a YouTube video about TONSquare! Like, câ€™mon, keep that negativity to yourself, man. Donâ€™t let your personal opinions mess with the community vibe.

honestly, itâ€™s just some dudeâ€™s opinion, man. people are gonna have their say, but let time do the talking. if you think itâ€™s a scam, coolâ€”letâ€™s see how it plays out. no need to get all worked up about it. just chill and let the project speek for itself! and for real, go take a hike with that negativity!

A video of a smug, speculative and imposing person. Havenâ€™t found anything convincing about these projects being scams, and this idiot is trying to poison crypto participants with this trash video!

lol bro, did you even do your own research before coming here and gaslighting about a scam project and fake partnerships?? seriously, do your own homework! spreading fake news isnâ€™t cool at all. get your facts straight before you start throwing shade!

honestly, itâ€™s pretty annoying to see all this negativity. if youâ€™ve got concerns, fine, but at least make sure youâ€™re not just spreading rumors! do your research before jumping to conclusions.

Shut up and be aware thatâ€™s a scam. You know that and you keep on frauding. Check TOS Telegram and X posts, every comment mentions scam. Now investors are aware. Tell your friends that some investor is not stupid as you, legal actions will be taken. No mainnet, no value, devs have Millions in TON. If youâ€™re interested in knowing more and the truth, ask me and Iâ€™ll provide you all wallets involved. If you just want to keep on shilling shit, just stfu.
