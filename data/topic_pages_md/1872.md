Hello all TON enthusiasts, you must be familiar with us

We are building a quality and degen community on TON to ensure benefits for all participants. So who are those subjects?

1.  Users: We always ensure to give users the best experience: News about TON and projects on TON, opportunity to receive airdrops from the project, understand more about how to interact with TON Blockchain, etc.
2.  Projects: We provide comprehensive support for projects, especially new and quality projects. Not only Marketing and Community Building, we also support project development, especially dev on TON.
3.  TON Foundation: We plan to organize offline events at our local area, deploy courses to help on-board add more quality users and developers to the TON Blockchain.

So what do we want to propose here?

Besides being a simple community, we are developing tools to help the project more easily develop its marketing and community, making it easier for users to interact with TON Blockchain.

Therefore, we are wondering about launching our token - $TDEGEN to achieve our goals.

Launching the token will not be for profit purposes but will focus on creating a community where the rights of holders are guaranteed, creating fairness and civilization for all members of the community. We can assign a reputable third party to audit this part.

What do you think about this idea?

We are always aiming for decentralization so please let us know if you support this idea or not!

It would be nice if the TON Foundation support more offline events. It could bring a lot of value.

We look forward to seeing your application again in the future.

Thank you.
