> # What is TONMinutes?
> 
> We are a team of 2 who are active in the hypercasual scene. Due to our work, we of course monitor the development of the game industry very carefully. Each and every one of us is also interested in the blockchain and its possibilities, so that we have come across Play2Earn games from time to time. Of course only for research reasons, as it should be for reasonable developers, we of course played some of these games.
> 
> We noticed that many of the games were more basic games with no frills, just existing concepts that were relatively heartlessly adapted to the blockchain, with the purpose of pushing a game token that was just as simple deployed to the market as the game itself was. At this point, I’m sure that some games have already crossed your mind. Yes, it’s exactly that game we’re gossiping about right now.
> 
> Of course there are also pieces of jewelry, my personal favorite is “Gods Unchained”. The game is far from finished and still has its quirks, but as a Hearthstone fan from the very beginning, I’ve had a lot of fun. Angry tongues will blur that it is only a copy of a well-known game deployed on the blockchain. I just say, yes, right, but it was done well and is just fun! Collecting is satisfying thanks to the combination of NFT creation with different material levels, which cannot be said of other trading card games. At this point, hats off “Gods Unchained”.
> 
> Of course we came across other giants like “Axie Infinity” along the way. Axie is really very smart, the idea of ​​NFTs is used very well here. That made a lot of people to put on their own versions of the same system, but let’s stay with Axie.
> 
> Breeding is fun and is associated with a certain tension, of course a certain tactic is also required here. In my opinion, the game itself is not the best. A huge community has formed around it, with scholarships and everything, but it is rather monotonous. The guys are still doing it right, as the entry of Samsung Next proves.
> 
> In all the games we encountered, one thing particularly bothered us, either the investment was much too high or it just took an incredibly long time to collect a few pennies. Play2Earn sounds more like a promise that has not been kept. In the games where you can really make money, like Axie Infinity, entry is simply not possible for many players.
> 
> This is where we come into play. We wanted to solve the problem of long monotonous playing times just for a rather small return and the problem of high entry costs in order to actually be able to earn money.
> 
> TONMinutes was born!
> 
> # What is the TONMinutes Game Series?
> 
> TONMinutes is not a single game, but a series of games in which the aim is to achieve the high score within 10 minutes. But let’s start from the beginning:
> 
> First of all, the player must have mint a ticket to participate in a game session.
> 
> The price is $ 45, which is the average price you would pay for a new game. Of course, we also distribute tickets through competitions or giveaways, about which you can find out more in the upcoming posts.
> 
> Once the Game Starts, you have 24 hours to start your own game session and set a high score within 10 minutes. We will reveal the game shortly before the start of each session. Most of the time, it will be an endless games that is hardly more difficult than Flappy Bird. You can restart as often as you like in your 10 minutes and break your own high score. The highest rating is entered in the leaderboard together with your wallet address and your ticket ID. Based on your position on the leaderboard, you will receive a profit that will differ from session to session.
> 
> Pretty simple, right?
> 
> # Rewards
> 
> Let’s take the example of the first session, in which a maximum of 10,000 players can participate. As said, the ticket will cost around 45 USD, whereby we will use TON as the currency, as we will bring our Tickets out on The Open Network. We use TON, because the gas fees are particularly low here, so that you actually come to just under 45 USD and the price does not double, as it would be the case on Ethereum Mainnet.
> 
> When all Tickets have been sold, the first game session will give a total of 270,000 USD in prize money. In this example, first place receives 80,000 USD, second place 20,000 USD and third place 10,000 USD for 10 minutes of play! Here you have an overview of all other placements:
> 
> `1st Place: $ 80,000`
> 
> `2nd Place: $ 20,000`
> 
> `3rd Place: $ 10,000`
> 
> `4th Place: $ 8,000`
> 
> `5th Place: $ 7,000`
> 
> `6th Place: $ 6,000`
> 
> `7th Place: $ 5,000`
> 
> `8th Place: $ 4,000`
> 
> `9th Place: $ 3,500`
> 
> `10th Place: $ 3,000`
> 
> `Top 25%: $ 50 for each player`
> 
> Yes, you read that right! If you reach the top 25% of the leaderboard you will receive $50 as a prize. Such high winnings in such a short time are not paid out in any other game. This is just an example of a reward distribution. With every game, the distribution can change.
