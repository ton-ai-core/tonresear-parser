We are committed to building trust, offering help to others, bringing hope to society, and encouraging people not to lose faith in life or feel disappointed in the world. We treat everyone with sincerity because we hope to bring hope to everyone. We will not force anyone to believe in us, nor will we ask you to do anything you don‚Äôt want to do. We have created a game, and we hope to build a strong community through it to help more people in need. This is the significance of SEED‚Äôs existence, and your participation is our greatest hope at present, while helping you will be our eternal hope. Finally, we wish you all a happy time playing, and we will always be with you, growing continuously, and bringing you hope.
