# [](#burncoin-the-first-and-only-ton-token-that-actually-burns-we-burn-5-of-every-sell-1)Burncoin — The first and only TON token that actually burns. We burn 5% of every sell.

$BURN is not just a memecoin, but a utility token for the future protocol on TON.  
We plan to make not an ordinary jetton, but build a unique project with innovative on-chain mechanics.  
We are the first to add deflationary onchain mechanics to a token on TON; 5% of every sale burns forever.

But that’s not the only BURN feature…

# [](#roadmap-2)Roadmap

Later, we will allow users to mint NFTs that reflect their current Burn Points balance.Thus, these NFTs will be a kind of Proof-of-Burn certificate.  
In the future, these NFTs will have different privileges depending on their balance.

Our roadmap can be also found on our [site](https://burncoin.org/) and in the [docs](https://docs.burncoin.org/roadmap)

By the beginning of Q3, we plan to release MVP of the prediction market protocol on TON. The mechanics are similar to the prediction game on [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/prediction).

Players will be able to bet on the short-term price changes of different cryptoassets. For this purpose, our on-chain protocol will utilize a [RedStone](https://redstone.finance/) oracle price feed.

The winners’ pool of funds will share the losers’ pool of funds. However, a part of the winners’ pool will go to the revenue of the protocol. We will share a portion of this profit with the holders.

In order to make it attractive, everything will be available in a simple and gamified form via the Telegram Mini App.

# [](#key-metrics-3)Key Metrics

On April 20, we raised **35k TON in 3 minutes** at the presale. It was attended by 450+ people.  
The number of holders more than tripled during the week.

For the presale, we made custom smart contracts that returned funds after reaching a hardcap and allowed participants to claim BURN.

![metrics](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d135ed7288911ecc54e06e998e0fd82397cbd7c5.png)  
as for 27 April 2024

Burners are already earning Burn Points without realizing it.

Later, we will allow users to mint NFTs that reflect their current Burn Points balance. Thus, these NFTs will be a kind of Proof-of-Burn certificate.

In the future, these NFTs will have different privileges depending on their balance.

GREAT token, worth trusting because the LPs are blocked and part of them are burned and there is an excellent utility when selling a token, 5% is burned (10% has already been burned!!!)
