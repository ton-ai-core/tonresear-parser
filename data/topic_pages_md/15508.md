Froge is a new ecosystem on the TON blockchain, capturing the most popular industries in cryptocurrency. The main focus is on DeFi and DEX. In addition to the decentralized finance aspect, the FrogeWallet wallet, FrogeLaunch launchpad and P2E project aggregator are in development.  
Our goal is to provide the most transparent project, built entirely together with the community using DAO elements.  
The Froge ecosystem provides many use cases for the user - from staking the native Froge token and providing liquidity to pools to participating in presales and participating in the development of P2E projects.  
To get a detailed look at the project, we suggest going to the website and looking at the white paper, where you can also find the road map.

Hello team

Thank you for taking the time to apply for The Open League.

After a thorough review, we must inform you that, unfortunately, your product’s traction does not meet our current eligibility criteria. You can find these criteria through this link \[[About the Token & Memecoin Battle: Minor League category](https://tonresear.ch/t/about-the-token-leaderboard-minor-league-category/1274)\].

Once the criteria are met from your side, please feel free to resubmit your application for the future seasons.

We look forward to seeing your application again in the future.

Thank you!
