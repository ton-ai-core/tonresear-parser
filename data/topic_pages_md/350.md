*   **TonApiClient**: Focused on providing a high-level indexing API, recommended for scanning extensive transaction and contract datasets.
    

## [](#contract-interactions-7)Contract Interactions

TonTools abstracts contract interactions, enabling developers to seamlessly work with various contract types such as NFT items, collections, sales, jettons, and wallets. Each contract inherits from a base `Contract` class, providing methods like `.get_transactions()`, `.run_get_method()`, `.get_balance()`, and `.get_state()`, applicable across different contract types.

### [](#examples-8)Examples

*   **NFT Contracts**: Managing NFT Items, Collections, and Sales.
*   **Jetton Contracts**: Handling Jetton and Jetton Wallet interactions.
*   **Wallet Contracts**: Includes the `Wallet` class for managing blockchain wallets, with future plans to introduce HighLoadWallet and MultiSigWallet.

### [](#transactions-and-messages-9)Transactions and Messages

The `Transaction` class offers methods to convert transaction data into both full and user-friendly formats, aiding in the analysis and presentation of transaction information. Additionally, messages can be categorized using the `.try_detect_type()` method, enhancing data interpretation and usability.
