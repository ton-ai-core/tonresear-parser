The TON Blockchain (The Open Network) is a fast, secure, and scalable blockchain and network project, designed to handle millions of transactions per second. In this post, we’ll take a closer look at a specific component of the TON ecosystem: the HighloadWalletContractV2. This contract is a crucial element for developers working on high-load applications that require efficient and reliable wallet management.

## [](#highloadwalletcontractv2-an-overview-1)HighloadWalletContractV2: An Overview

The HighloadWalletContractV2 is a sophisticated smart contract designed for managing wallets in high-load scenarios. It is defined in the [HighloadWalletV2.ts](https://github.com/ndatg/ton-highload-wallet-contract/blob/50365e0/src/HighloadWalletV2.ts#L18) file and implements the `Contract` interface.

### [](#key-features-2)Key Features:

*   **Address Management:** The contract provides a read-only `address` property, which holds the wallet’s address.
*   **Initialization Data:** The `init` property contains the contract’s code and data cells, essential for its initialization.
*   **Public Key Access:** The `publicKey` property allows access to the wallet’s public key, a critical component for transaction security.
*   **Wallet and Workchain ID:** The contract includes `walletId` and `workchain` properties for identifying the wallet and its associated workchain.

### [](#core-methods-3)Core Methods:

1.  **createTransfer:** Generates a transfer request with a specified body and query ID.
2.  **getBalance:** Retrieves the current balance of the wallet.
3.  **getProcessed:** Checks the status of a transaction using its query ID.
4.  **getPublicKey:** Obtains the wallet’s public key in string format.
5.  **send:** Submits a signed transfer message to the network.
6.  **sendTransfer:** Signs and sends a transfer request.
7.  **sender:** Creates a sender instance for managing transactions.

### [](#static-methods-4)Static Methods:

*   **create:** Instantiates a new HighloadWalletContractV2 with the given parameters.
*   **generateQueryId:** Produces a unique query ID for transaction tracking.
