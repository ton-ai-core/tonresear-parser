## [](#technical-overview-4)Technical Overview

The wallet operates under two primary authentication modes: signature-based and extension-based, accommodating all standard output actions along with three additional operation types. These enhancements ensure that all operation types are accessible across authentication modes, underlining the wallet’s versatility.

### [](#operational-modes-5)Operational Modes

*   **Authentication**: Facilitated through either signature or extension.
*   **Operation Types**: Encompasses standard output actions, data setting, extension installation, and removal.

### [](#extensibility-and-upgrades-6)Extensibility and Upgrades

The Extensible Wallet V5 emphasizes the use of extensions to broaden functionality, allowing other contracts to perform actions as if they were the wallet owner. It introduces a systematic approach to performing code optimizations and emergency upgrades without necessitating a change in the wallet address, ensuring backward compatibility and minimizing disruptions for users.

## [](#discussion-highlights-7)Discussion Highlights

*   **Purpose and Limitations**: The wallet is designed for single-user operation, directing multi-user operations to alternative solutions like multisig or DAO.
*   **Extending Functionality**: Extensions offer a scalable way to enhance wallet capabilities, with the potential for code optimization and emergency upgrades as needed.
*   **Gas Fee Outsourcing**: The wallet supports gas fee payment by third parties, simplifying transactions.
*   **Plugin Implementation**: Plugins can implement subscriptions and collect tokens, with provisions for self-destruction and efficient deployment.

## [](#wallet-id-and-packed-address-8)Wallet ID and Packed Address

The specification introduces a unique wallet ID to differentiate between wallet versions and chains, alongside an efficient method for address compression to streamline extension authorization.

## [](#tl-b-definitions-and-source-code-9)TL-B Definitions and Source Code

The document provides detailed TL-B definitions for actions and authentication modes, alongside the complete source code for the wallet, available in the specified repository.

## [](#conclusion-10)Conclusion

The Extensible Wallet V5 specification lays the foundation for a versatile, efficient, and forward-looking digital wallet. Its design not only reduces operational costs but also paves the way for a decentralized, extensible ecosystem, offering a robust framework for the future of digital transactions.
