Today the PocketFi team announced new boost system. The old boosts are still there, but they added some new ones and a new airdrops tab.

![:heavy_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/heavy_check_mark.png?v=12 ":heavy_check_mark:") **Daily Check-ins**

Starting today, you can claim $SWITCH tokens **daily** through the **Daily Boost**. Your $SWITCH token claim count increases each day until you reach a 10-day streak, at which point you can claim **55 tokens**. Miss a day? No worries — you’ll start again from day one.

![:new_moon_with_face:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/new_moon_with_face.png?v=12 ":new_moon_with_face:") **New basic tasks**

To accelerate your base speed mining, complete the X (formerly Twitter) task (+0.5 switch/hour boost) and connect your TON Wallet (+1 switch/hour boost).

![:gift:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/gift.png?v=12 ":gift:") **Airdrops**

Although this tab is currently locked, stay tuned! Soon, you’ll find new tasks that allow you to receive different projects tokens.
