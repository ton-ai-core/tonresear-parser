Looking for developer help and ideas for building a crypto tap 2 earn game based on the old Drug wars pc game. The idea is kinda complex, involving worldwide game play and cooperation between different players in different geographical locations around the world. The purpose of the game is to expand your empire by trading geographically native coins for coins from other countries. Different coins will have different values depending on where the player is located and the object is to sell to areas that have more demand for certain coins and buy from areas that have a cheaper supply. You can create networks and expand your empire across the globe. I have a rough design drawn up of the game if your interested and can help me bring it to life , let me know.
