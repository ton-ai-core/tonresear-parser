Yes, this project was reviewed objectively. Smart contract approved. Their social interactions were controlled. It was observed that there was an extremely high interaction. Coingecko listing is complete. A team review was conducted and it was observed that they were in communication with the community and transparent. Nothing negative was reported. They have a chance to get into the Open League. Investment can be made.

Hello team,

Thank you for taking the time to apply for The Open League.

After a thorough review, we must inform you that, unfortunately, your project does not meet our current eligibility criteria. You can find them through this link: [About the Token & Memecoin Battle category - #7 by PopRocks](https://tonresear.ch/t/about-the-token-memecoin-battle-category/1274/7)

Once your project aligns with these criteria, please feel free to resubmit your application for the future seasons.

We look forward to seeing your application again in the future.

Thank you.
