Hi, please help with the tone of the sites.  
The problem is that for some reason Apple devices work extremely poorly. Cookies do not hold and because of this it is impossible to place an order, write a review, enter a captcha, remove notifications, and so on. Has anyone encountered such a problem? Help solve it, we are ready to pay hourly for help.

And on Mac OS, it is completely impossible to enter either a login or password for authorization, because the site opens in the mobile version and for some reason there is no keyboard, it does not load.

Help please.
