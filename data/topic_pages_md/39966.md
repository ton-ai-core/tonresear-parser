13.  \*\*Briefly describe your memecoinâ€™s strategy for growth and community engagement:  
    The Mr. MeMe game is a competitive crypto project using the first multi-chain community token MMM that plans to become the largest meme in history.
    

Players participate in cyclical seasons where they farm points and compete for a share of the overall reward pool. To participate in farming, a player needs to log in via Telegram bot or website and activate the point farming process.

The main feature of the Mr. MeMe game is tying the gameplay to the MMM meme token. Players can increase their chances of winning by leveling up their account through the purchase of MMM tokens, which increases the farming power and unlocks additional benefits such as autofarming. Interaction with other players also plays an important role: invited friends increase the power of farming, which encourages social interaction and community growth. The MMM token across all networks is launched through memcoin launch sites.\*\*
