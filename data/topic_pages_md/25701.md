Hello team,

Thank you for taking the time to apply for The Open League.

After a thorough review, we must inform you that, unfortunately, we cannot accept you into The Open League due to reputational issues in the TON community and a lack of faith in the team’s ability to deliver based on past history.

Thank you!
