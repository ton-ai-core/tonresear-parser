Hey guys I’m Marceau, I’m working at Ta-da, a platform that collects data for AI. The purpose is simple, we create tasks for companies that need data to train their AI in our app, and the community is rewarded for providing and checking the data quality to ensure it matches the requirements. This can be voice, pictures, videos, annotation, anything that can be done through a smartphone basically.

We’d love to add tasks for projects in need for data and list partners within our app!

We are about to launch on TON very soon, and we have grants and micro-grants programs going on, who could help us move forward with that and create synergies between projects ?

All the best,  
Marceau
