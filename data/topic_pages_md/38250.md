I am a $YUME holder and I can say for sure that the community here is simply incredible. I have never met people in any token who support the project as much as here.

Proud $YUME holder and supporter. The quality of memes , utility that has been made and still coming, community and holders conviction is something that every billion market cap tokens have. The small volume on chain or no focus on memes right now never stopped $YUME from building!

It never will stop delivering.
