With risk-free custody through non-custodial design and institutional-grade MPC, UTONIC ensures security and decentralization. It supports scenario-based AVS solutions for gaming, social, payments, and AI in collaboration with Web2 and Web3 partners, while offering principal-protected fund management and flexible asset acceptance (TON, tsTON, stTON) to maximize user earnings and deliver additional benefits like airdrops and loss insurance.
