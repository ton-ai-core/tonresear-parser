As the Ton community growing everyday,a new airdrop game rise afterward which it spreads the community into multiple games.after a couple of months we would have lots of coins listed on the market.so what we get in the market?most likely low worth coins which traders rush to sell them at the highest rate at the begging getting low profit out of it ![:hot_face:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/hot_face.png?v=12 ":hot_face:") and the rate goes low and low due to high supply.  
What can we do?  
As a HUGE society we may better to focus on 1 single airdrop game every 6 month to get the highest potential profit out of 1 single coin in the market.  
Together we rise,together we punch
