**Abstract**

The Open Nework (TON) Blockchain introduces an innovative slashing mechanism aimed at enhancing network security and maintaining validator accountability. This article delves into the technicalities of this mechanism, focusing on the detection, complaint, and penalization processes for idle validators. Developed by igroman787, the mechanism is integrated into the `mytonctrl` tool, facilitating the automatic generation of complaints against underperforming validators and the subsequent voting process.

**Introduction**

The TON Blockchain operates with a dynamic set of validators responsible for processing transactions and creating blocks. Ensuring the active participation of these validators is crucial for the network’s integrity and performance. To address this, the TON community has implemented a slashing mechanism, which penalizes validators failing to fulfill their duties.

**Implementation Details**

The slashing process begins after the validation period, where validators audit each other’s performance based on the number of processed blocks. Validators using `mytonctrl` can automatically generate and vote on complaints against idle validators, employing a variety of TON tools and scripts.

**Testing and Validation**

Initially, to encourage participation and allow for the testing of the new mechanism, the penalty was set at a nominal value of 101 coins. This approach ensures validators are not discouraged during the initial phase, while still promoting active engagement and responsibility.

**Technical Overview**

The process involves several steps, starting from the validation of validator performance, complaint generation, and ending with the voting on these complaints. Key technical aspects include:

1.  **Performance Check**: Validators assess each other’s contribution using `lite-client` commands, focusing on the blocks created within a specific timeframe.
2.  **Complaint Generation**: If a validator’s performance is found lacking, and no existing complaint is present, a new complaint is generated using `fift` scripts and `validator-engine-console` commands.
3.  **Voting on Complaints**: Valid complaints are then subject to voting by the other validators. A validator can vote on a complaint if they haven’t already voted against the accused validator within the same validation period.

**Results and Future Work**

The implementation of this slashing mechanism is a step forward in enhancing the TON Blockchain’s security and efficiency. Early tests indicate a positive impact on validator engagement and network performance. Future work will focus on refining the penalty system to ensure it effectively deters malicious or negligent behavior without discouraging participation.

**Conclusion**

The introduction of a slashing mechanism within the TON Blockchain represents a significant advancement in maintaining a secure and efficient network. By holding validators accountable and incentivizing active participation, TON continues to develop as a robust and trustworthy blockchain platform.
