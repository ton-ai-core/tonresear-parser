    \-_**StarAI is an innovative AI Mini App that enables users to refine cards through AI and receive NFT airdrops. This app supports one-click Free Mint NFTs on the TON chain, making it the first to utilize AI for generating NFTs and providing all users with Free Mint access. By enhancing the aesthetics of NFTs through AI, StarAI aims to lower the entry barriers and attract more users to trade NFTs on the TON chain. In August 2024, the StarAI NeroPunk NFT attracted over 600 users and resulted in the Free Mint of 2,000 exquisite NFTs within just one week. We will continue to develop products that empower NFTs with AI, increasing transaction volume and market exposure.**_
