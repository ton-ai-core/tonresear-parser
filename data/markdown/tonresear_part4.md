Is the monetary webApp game in the strategy genre with a social aspect, allowing participants to create and monetize their own world. The scarcity of plots for building cities will create focal points (centers) that attract user attention, increasing the income of cluster creators.

SAU tokens will be used to purchase plots, goods, and services in the virtual world.  
SAU will also be used to incentivize content creation and decision-making by users, thereby creating a decentralized virtual world.

The development of large proprietary platforms, such as Telegram, has enabled hundreds of millions of users to gather, interact, exchange content, and play games. Their network effects have helped create extensive online communities and gaming companies. These platforms control network rules and content flow, while generating significant revenue from communities and content creators who direct traffic to the platforms.

The Saudis TON aims to create a network that allows participants to own and receive full benefits from their contributions.

The founder of the token initially made some mistakes when put up liquidity. But after that he fix everything, which is really worthy of respect. Few people are ready to admit mistakes and learn all the details of blockchain with such dedication.

Founder - popular person with a lot of experience with psychodelics, much part of his content based on ideas about healing strange of psychodelics, ideas that they can make your life and mental health better, and lot of science researchers agree with that  
On this content, founder find a lot of people who thinks same, so founder start his token just for closed - community inside telegram, and the comunity have shown their strange, no one from early buyers wasnt sell the token, not at 10x, not at 100x, not at 1000x.  
Thats shows strange of founder‚Äôs community, that people buying this token not for money, but for idea!  
And you can join this token, join powerful community, with powerful ideas, to make this world better for everyone of us!

I know roughly nothing about the DMT token as well as cryptocurrency in general and this post was put together with the help of AI, but:

¬´I started following the author on TikTok last year, and their content has been not only helpful but also inspiring. They cover a range of topics, from practical advice to deeper existential reflections, which helped me broaden my understanding of the world. The internet plays a crucial role in accessing such content, and the author has been one of those who added valuable ‚Äògrains of wisdom‚Äô to my life.

I want to commend their work with the DMT token, which, as I understand, is an innovative cryptocurrency project. They plan to implement the token‚Äôs use in August 2024, and I believe this will be a significant step for their community. Supporting initiatives like theirs, which contribute to development and innovation, is important.

I‚Äôll be keeping an eye on the development of the DMT token and wish its creators success in their endeavor to make a positive impact.¬ª

Thx for reading, btw. And have a good day, friend‚úåÔ∏è

# [Microdiving - Real working production is tokenized](/t/microdiving-real-working-production-is-tokenized/27181)

[General](/c/general/4) 

    

[Angelskii](https://tonresear.ch/u/Angelskii)  July 3, 2024, 7:08am  1

Real working production is tokenized and allows holders of their coin to choose clothing designs and receive up to 30% profit on sales

Microdiving Coin ( $MIC ) - directly linked to real fabric. 1 $MIC = 1 meter of fabric.

Manufacturing has already prepared 1 kilometer of different fabrics for use in the blockchain.

Holders can actively participate in the garment design process via a special chat room, and in the future via a tg bot.

Holders will receive up to 30% cashback from the margin on goods whose design was created with their participation. Also income will come from bonus programs.

This is not a scam. I communicated with the owner and found out all the details. He is public, you can ask him additional questions yourself - @Andril10

Right now NFT firelaunch is going on and you can invest in production at launch at the best price Ton Raffles has to offer [Ton Raffles](https://tonraffles.app/nft/launchpad/EQC46W25gnrdrK9Y4ueC2McP2DwAsA3oe-yXp36OjGVJ6vBO/UQAl17oY5sIWnRFB75K7NYBkpQCzxxRw6vHe70o7QZiat0Lr)

You can see all the supporting photos and videos on the official Telegram channel of the project - @microdiving

I highly recommend to support the guys, to help in their bold idea, well, and in the future to earn of course.

1.  Funds raised: We intended to raise 150-200k and actually raised 150,000 USDT on TonUP and 50,000 USDT on GoWrap, totally 200,000 USDT.
2.  Participants: Double confirmed, totally around 300 wallets, roughly half from TonUP and half from GoWrap, with nearly 50% of them bought a hard cap. And all these are sold in a few minutes, so hundreds failed to buy due to huge demand but limited supply.

# [How to make money on NFT Microdiving before the ZBT starts on August 1?](/t/how-to-make-money-on-nft-microdiving-before-the-zbt-starts-on-august-1/27200)

[General](/c/general/4)

![:moneybag:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/moneybag.png?v=12 ":moneybag:") Airdrop for Holders: Until the closed beta test starts, your goal is simply to hold NFT and $MIC tokens. We have allocated $4,000 and 41666 $MIC tokens for airdrop among NFT holders. Starting from the moment all NFTs are minted, we will be replenishing the award pool. This is your chance to earn passive income just for holding NFTs.

![:chart_with_upwards_trend:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/chart_with_upwards_trend.png?v=12 ":chart_with_upwards_trend:") Passive income from NFTs: In the attributes of each NFT there is a margin percentage of 5% to 40% depending on the rarity of the NFT. If an NFT has copies, the income is shared among all holders of those copies. This creates an incentive to exchange and crossbreed NFTs among participants to increase the rarity and thus the percentage of income.

![:twisted_rightwards_arrows:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/twisted_rightwards_arrows.png?v=12 ":twisted_rightwards_arrows:") Crossbreeding NFTs: Increase the rarity of your NFTs by crossbreeding them. This not only increases your passive income, but also allows you to create a monopoly on a certain type of item. When you crossbreed, the income from the original model is distributed among the new copies, increasing your share of the overall pool.

**Details to share**

Project Description  
CoinPUPS is a meme-based clicking game in telegram set to launch in early July. The team comes from a VC-backed game studio called Blade Games having raised $2.4mm from PTC Crypto, Animoca Ventures, Signum Capital, IOSG ventures and a few other reputable funds in the space (can be disclosed if required). We aim to reward players with meme tokens such as SHIB, BONK and will collaborate with leading infrastructure projects such as 0G Labs on token airdrops. TGE is set to be in mid August to mid September.

_Primary Goals:_

1.  Create an engaging casual game that attracts a large user base with large cap meme tokens as incentives.
    
2.  Integrate blockchain features for transparency, security, and potentially rewarding users with cryptocurrency.
    
3.  Use the TON blockchain for in-game transactions, ensuring fast and low-cost operations.
    

_Token Launch Strategy_

We plan to use in-game purchases of speed-up bundles and gacha boxes to gain more in-game currencies. More currency the players hold, the more potential meme coins they can get through each batch of activities.

Token incentives are available from Blade Games, 0G Labs and a few more key infrastructure projects. We will also do cross-promotion with Catizen and [XPlus.io](http://XPlus.io).

TGE is set to be in late August or mid September. We are connected with exchanges such as Bybit, Bitget and [Gate.io](http://Gate.io). ForesightX is also one of the team‚Äôs investors.

_Value for Users_  
Users will be rewarded in the following ways:

*   Large cap memecoins such as SHIB, BONK, Ton Inu, Ton Doge if they reach certain levels and invite friends
*   Airdrop events with Blade Games, 0G Labs, and potentially with Orbiter Finance. More infra project token rewards will be added
*   Cash rewards for inviting users to play and engage with the game
*   Raffle rewards with various game projects on TON

Enormous meme potential based on pretty much universal humour, tiny mcap with an abundance of liquidity, and still at a point where it hasn‚Äôt really grown at all (when converted to Ton).

Perfect stats for explosive growth short-term, even better as a long-term investment by the time mass adoption happens.

Hello, this project has been found to be scamming the audience.  
It was confirmed that the scam affected 1500 wallets.

It‚Äôs totally FUD.  
Project has been running for more than 2 years, it is being built only with community funds, the article contains only the whining of one person who cannot understand that development is hard work and is difficult to predict, no one has deceived anyone, approximate dates are given and it‚Äôs based on a different game altogether.

Your comment is deliberately misleading and should be removed.

Tongochi great project. Yes, launching of game was delayed, but we believe in project and team behind it. Why do we believe? Because Ilya and others founders speak honestly about process of creation of game. But they have a successful case and if it will be scam I guess there are more professional method about how to scam people. Tongochi is not scam.

You are so funny, Bro ![:sweat_smile:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=12 ":sweat_smile:") Really. How long are you in TON? How long are you in crypto? How much have you lost personally in $PET? With proofs, please.

A lot of TON projects are facing delays, when they are building from scratch. Some delays are caused by regulation, by wars, by technical issues and global crypto and financial markets conditions, independent from team‚Äôs desires and efforts. Basically, by lots of factors called force-major in world‚Äôs justice practice. The team is well known to all TON community, building its products for more than two years.

Then what kind of scam are you talking about? Are you kidding?

Have you seen those hundreds of pictures and worthless transactions in your wallet with promises of millions of TON and USDT ‚Äòairdrops‚Äô. That‚Äôs how scam really looks like.

$PET, Tongochi and Zombietown is definitely not a scam. Delays? Yes. But definitely not a scam.

I‚Äôd recommend you to remove that your weird blaming post above. And let‚Äôs go and contribute in TON growth all together ![:ok_hand:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/ok_hand.png?v=12 ":ok_hand:")

I was new to the world of crypto since a month or so ago when I stumbled across REDO. Historically I tried using other blockchains however it always felt overwhelming and the UI was frustrating. TON is so elevated in comparison. I can only thank REDO for making me aware of TON‚Äôs huge potential. Such an amazing community! The quality of the narrative, graphics and most importantly the people of REDO is unique.

> _There are two wolves inside you. The furry convention is going well. (c) Jason Statham_

A strong candidate for the Minor League despite its humble meme origins, $STATHAM has been in the state of consolidation for the past month and a half, ready to rocket away at the earliest opportunity.

Fair token distribution, remarkable amount of liquidity, and diamond-hand holders make up for a beautiful start of a long and eventful journey.

# [Leveraging PyTonConnect for Enhanced TON Blockchain Integration: A Technical Guide](/t/leveraging-pytonconnect-for-enhanced-ton-blockchain-integration-a-technical-guide/275)

[Application](/c/application/ton-connect/42)  [TON Connect](/c/application/ton-connect/42) 

    

[Einstein](https://tonresear.ch/u/Einstein)   February 5, 2024, 11:48am  1

In the rapidly evolving landscape of blockchain technologies, the TON (The Open Network) Blockchain stands out for its unique features and capabilities. This technical article delves into the PyTonConnect Python SDK, a pivotal tool designed for seamless integration with TON wallets via the TonConnect protocol. PyTonConnect serves as a Python analogue of the `@tonconnect/sdk` library, offering developers a streamlined approach to connect their applications to TON wallets.

#### [](#installation-1)Installation

To get started with PyTonConnect, install the Python 3 package using the following command:

```
pip3 install pytonconnect
```

#### [](#setting-up-the-application-manifest-2)Setting Up the Application Manifest

A crucial initial step involves creating a `tonconnect-manifest.json` file, which contains metadata for wallet interaction. This JSON file must include essential fields such as `url`, `name`, and `iconUrl`, with optional fields for terms of use and privacy policy URLs. Ensuring the manifest‚Äôs availability via its URL is vital for successful integration.

#### [](#establishing-and-restoring-connections-3)Establishing and Restoring Connections

PyTonConnect allows for the initialization of a connector and the restoration of wallet connections if previously established. The following example demonstrates initializing the connector and calling `restore_connection` to check for an existing wallet connection:

```
import asyncio
from pytonconnect import TonConnect

async def main():
    connector = TonConnect(manifest_url='https://example.com/tonconnect-manifest.json')
    is_connected = await connector.restore_connection()
    print('is_connected:', is_connected)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```

#### [](#wallet-interaction-4)Wallet Interaction

Developers can fetch a list of supported wallets and subscribe to connection status changes to update the application UI accordingly. Initializing wallet connections through universal links facilitates user interaction, allowing for the generation of QR codes or deep links for wallet approval.

#### [](#transaction-handling-5)Transaction Handling

Sending transactions is a straightforward process with PyTonConnect. By defining a transaction object and invoking `send_transaction`, developers can execute transactions on the TON blockchain. The SDK provides mechanisms for handling user rejections and other exceptions to ensure a smooth transaction flow.

#### [](#conclusion-6)Conclusion

PyTonConnect offers a robust and efficient pathway for integrating Python applications with TON wallets, fostering enhanced interaction with the TON blockchain. By leveraging this SDK, developers can significantly streamline the development process, from setting up application manifests to handling transactions, thereby unlocking new possibilities for blockchain applications.

**Project Overview:**  
$TDOG is a vibrant memecoin launched on the gasPump platform, featuring a dog in an astronaut suit as its iconic design. Our project embodies the ideology of PPP (PLAYER PUMP PLAYER), where community-driven growth is paramount. Managed by the community, LP tokens have been burned, and governance rights are set to be decentralized.

**Token Utility:**  
$TDOG is more than just a memecoin; it‚Äôs a symbol of community solidarity and organic growth within the blockchain ecosystem. As we soar in value and visibility, our commitment to PPP remains unwavering, ensuring that every player in our community contributes to the token‚Äôs upward trajectory.

**\- Please provide detailed information on your token distribution, especially indicating the % of token supply held by the team and the status of the team‚Äôs LP tokens**

LP tokens have been fully burnt, ensuring a decentralized distribution among holders. The top holders are deeply committed to the success of $TDOG, reflecting our community‚Äôs dedication and belief in the project.

**\- Please describe your project roadmap for the next 6-12 months**

Over the next 6-12 months, $TDOG aims to expand its influence in the TON ecosystem, fostering a robust community through engaging initiatives and strategic partnerships. We are exploring innovative opportunities such as in-app games and NFTs to enhance interaction and value for our token holders.

**1\. Introduction**

The TON Blockchain, with its capability to handle a significant number of transactions and its split into two chains, represents a formidable platform for developers and miners alike. However, the efficiency of mining operations, particularly for individual miners, is compromised by several factors including the reliability of Liteservers and the operational load on API service providers.

**2\. Mining Process Overview**

Mining on the TON Blockchain involves a series of steps initiated by acquiring a mining task from a target smart contract. This task is then processed by a POW (Proof of Work) miner, typically within a one-minute timeframe. The challenge arises when a solution is found and submitted to the smart contract after another miner has already submitted a solution, leading to wasted effort and resources (burning GAS) on outdated tasks.

**3\. Challenges Identified**

*   **Liteserver Dependability:** The near inoperability of Liteservers across the globe significantly hinders the ability of miners to obtain and submit mining tasks.
*   **API Load:** Heavy reliance on external APIs, such as those provided by [getblock.io](http://getblock.io), introduces additional latency and reliability issues.
*   **Task Freshness:** Delays in receiving mining tasks and in halting the mining process for outdated tasks reduce the probability of successful mining.
*   **Submission Reliability:** The process of submitting solved tasks is prone to failures, notably due to packet loss.

**4\. Proposed Solutions**

Challenge

Solution

Liteserver Dependability

Establish independent nodes to reduce reliance on Liteservers and ensure task acquisition and submission reliability.

API Load

Diversify API usage and consider load balancing across multiple services to mitigate single points of failure.

Task Freshness

Implement real-time monitoring to ensure tasks are current and halt mining on outdated tasks immediately.

Submission Reliability

Opt for multiple submission attempts to account for network issues, ensuring that valid solutions are recognized by the smart contract.

Performance Optimization

Focus less on hardware overclocking as its impact on mining efficiency is minimal compared to network and software optimizations.

**5\. Conclusion**

While the TON Blockchain offers significant potential for miners, the efficiency of mining operations is heavily dependent on the reliability of the infrastructure used to acquire and submit tasks. By establishing independent nodes, diversifying API usage, ensuring task freshness, and adopting a robust submission strategy, miners can significantly enhance their chances of successful mining operations. This approach not only maximizes the utilization of computational resources but also ensures a more stable and predictable mining income.

## [](#optimizing-mining-strategies-on-ton-blockchain-navigating-high-tps-and-reward-challenges-1)Optimizing Mining Strategies on TON Blockchain: Navigating High TPS and Reward Challenges

[![Êà™Âúñ 2024-02-06 Êôö‰∏ä7.37.40](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/1X/977752896543d15b714caa896f3db9d065a40846_2_591x500.jpeg)

Êà™Âúñ 2024-02-06 Êôö‰∏ä7.37.401920√ó1622 123 KB

](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/original/1X/977752896543d15b714caa896f3db9d065a40846.jpeg "Êà™Âúñ 2024-02-06 Êôö‰∏ä7.37.40")

The TON (The Open Network) blockchain stands out for its impressive throughput, reaching up to 100 transactions per second (TPS), a figure that reflects its capacity to handle a significant volume of operations simultaneously. Within this high-transaction environment, a notable observation is the prevalence of mining-related transactions that fail to yield GRAM rewards for many participants. This phenomenon primarily stems from the submission of outdated solutions by miners, highlighting a critical challenge in the mining process on the TON blockchain.

**Understanding the Challenge**

A detailed examination of the mining transactions reveals that a substantial proportion of these efforts are unfruitful, attributing to the fast-paced nature of block generation and solution validation on the network. The table below summarizes the key issues contributing to the inefficacy of mining transactions:

Issue

Impact

Submission of Outdated Solutions

High likelihood of rewards not being allocated due to the solutions being obsolete by the time they are processed.

High Network Throughput (100 TPS)

Increases the competition among miners, leading to a majority of failed transactions.

**Strategies for Optimizing Mining Efficiency**

To navigate these challenges and enhance the success rate of mining operations on the TON blockchain, the following strategies are proposed:

1.  **Acquisition of Real-Time, Fresh Problems:** Ensuring that the mining tasks being worked on are up-to-date is crucial to avoid expending resources on already solved or outdated puzzles.
    
2.  **Dynamic Monitoring of Mining Tasks:** It is essential to monitor the mining software continuously to ascertain whether it is working on current problems. Immediate cessation of operations on outdated tasks can significantly boost efficiency.
    
3.  **Rapid Submission of Solutions:** Speed in submitting solutions to the network can be the difference between success and redundancy. Fast responses are more likely to be rewarded.
    
4.  **Persistent Submission Due to Unstable LiteServers:** Given the global instability of LiteServers, it is advisable to submit solutions multiple times to ensure they are processed.
    

**Conclusion**

The dynamic and competitive environment of the TON blockchain, characterized by its high transaction speed, poses unique challenges for miners aiming to secure rewards. By implementing the strategies outlined above, miners can significantly enhance their operational efficiency. This involves staying abreast of the latest puzzles, ceasing operations on outdated tasks, ensuring rapid submission of solutions, and compensating for LiteServer instabilities through multiple submissions. These adjustments are not merely tactical but are essential for any miner looking to navigate the complexities of the TON blockchain and maximize their reward potential.

*   Paper Plane ($PLANE)
*   [x.com](https://x.com/paperplane_ton)
*   Paper $PLANE is a memecoin based on the historic moment when Russia tried to ban Telegram in 2018 and Pavel Durov called on everyone to throw paper planes as a sign of resistance.

A paper plane is also associated with the iconic Telegram logo. Although $PLANE has no association with Telegram, the $PLANE logo is a mix of the old Telegram logo created in 2013 fused with the most current Telegram logo created in 2019.

Not only is $PLANE a memecoin with a timeless narrative, $PLANE has developed an addictive game playable directly as a Telegram app. This game has been used to bring awareness to the TON ecosystem by forging collaborations with other projects on TON.

Paper planes are timeless and knows no boundaries as they fly free and effortlessly, or better yet, as the founder of Telegram says,  
‚ÄúThe original meaning of the paper plane on the Telegram logo means freedom.‚Äù

*   $PLANE was a fair launch and is now a Community Take Over project so there are no team tokens. All expenses are paid for by the community raising money. All of the LP has been burned.

Reversive psychology or just the allure of the forbidden fruit?

As we know, ‚Äúscam‚Äù ain‚Äôt exactly a term of endearment. Red screams bear market and downfalls. And that straightforward description? Says it all.

All this creates an overwhelmingly negative vibe, which gets shattered once you dive deeper into the project.

What‚Äôs SCAM DAO about?

It‚Äôs folks united in a decentralized org, steering the project through a voting system and internal decision-making structure within the DAO.

Joining this exclusive club‚Äôs only possible with an NFT SCAM DAO PASS, snagged from GetGems or sold through a collective DAO decision for $SCAM tokens.

How not to buy?

You really don‚Äôt have to snag $SCAM via the top-notch Dedust service if getting rich ain‚Äôt your thing.

By submitting the form I confirm that the data I provided is correct and I fully understand that in case of the contrary, my project will be permanently eliminated from The Open League.

The second is more complex, where a user can not only add liquidity on a DEX but also lock LP tokens on our platform, in return receiving special in-game items at [https://api.tongochi.org/staking](https://api.tongochi.org/staking) .

# [Need developers for T2E crypto game based on ‚Äúdrug wars‚Äù old pc game](/t/need-developers-for-t2e-crypto-game-based-on-drug-wars-old-pc-game/28359)

[Application](/c/application/20) 

    

[DeganCyberval](https://tonresear.ch/u/DeganCyberval)  July 11, 2024, 8:16pm  1

Looking for developer help and ideas for building a crypto tap 2 earn game based on the old Drug wars pc game. The idea is kinda complex, involving worldwide game play and cooperation between different players in different geographical locations around the world. The purpose of the game is to expand your empire by trading geographically native coins for coins from other countries. Different coins will have different values depending on where the player is located and the object is to sell to areas that have more demand for certain coins and buy from areas that have a cheaper supply. You can create networks and expand your empire across the globe. I have a rough design drawn up of the game if your interested and can help me bring it to life , let me know.

# [MemeStore: Launch & Trade Your Memecoin Now on TON with One-click](/t/memestore-launch-trade-your-memecoin-now-on-ton-with-one-click/28419)

[Application](/c/application/20) 

    

[0x5f22](https://tonresear.ch/u/0x5f22)  July 12, 2024, 12:11pm  1

MemeStore is a meme launch platform on the Ton Blockchain, where everyone can launch their own memecoins in a simple and secure way. Currently, we have built two launching methods‚ÄîDirect Launch and Fair Launch‚Äîallowing you to issue a memetoken for 0.52 and 0.45 TON respectively.

**How does it work?**

Memecoins are created using either Direct Launch or Fair Launch modes. In Direct Launch, early participants can buy memecoins at a reasonable price and achieve substantial returns due to the bonding curve mechanism. Once enough holders possess a token and the market value reaches 8796 TON, all liquidity will be deposited into [Ston.fi](http://Ston.fi) and the LP tokens will be burned to ensure permanent liquidity.

According to the bonding curve pricing mechanism provided by MemeStore, early buyers will see a significant price increase in meme coins with a relatively small investment amount.

MemeStore‚Äôs Fair Launch mode, inspired by the BRC-20 and Runes rules, ensures fairness and transparency, providing all participants with an equal opportunity to obtain tokens.

Your memecoin is immediately tradable after launching.

**Innovative Invitation Mechanics**

We have also implemented an in-app invitation system to incentivize users to grow organically. We believe that with Telegram‚Äôs large user base, this product has the potential to grow significantly within the ecosystem.

Users can earn task and trading points by completing daily tasks and inviting others to trade on MemeStore. Points are the only way to receive airdrops, with task points accounting for 30% and trading points accounting for 70% of the weight.

Start launching on MemeStore via our Telegram [bot](https://t.me/MeMestoreioBot)

Deer has a unique economic model, with 50% of its supply allocated for IDO on the Tonup platform, another 25% distributed to form LP, and the remaining part will be used entirely for LP addition or burning. The launch was fair, with no pre-allocation to the team.

Hello DEER team,

Thank you for taking the time to apply for The Open League Season #1.

After a thorough review, we must inform you that, unfortunately, your token does not meet our current eligibility criteria. You can find them through this [link](https://tonresear.ch/t/about-the-memecoin-leaderboard-category/1276).

Once your token aligns with these criteria, please feel free to resubmit your application for the future seasons.

We look forward to seeing your application again in the future.

Thank you.

# [Update on the TONMinutes platform: Introduction of NFT tickets and new features! üéâ](/t/update-on-the-tonminutes-platform-introduction-of-nft-tickets-and-new-features/28500)

[The Open League](/c/the-open-league/56) 

    

[catikabu](https://tonresear.ch/u/catikabu)  July 12, 2024, 4:57pm  1

**Dear TON community members,**

We are excited to share with you some important updates about the TONMinutes platform!

**New Ticket Mining System: Introducing NFTs**

We have reworked the ticket minting system, and now every ticket on the platform is represented as an NFT. Previously, users sent TON to a personal wallet to participate in a gaming session, but now each ticket will be a unique NFT, giving it additional value and functionality.

**What do NFT tickets give after a gaming session?**

Don‚Äôt worry, NFT tickets will retain their value after the game. In the future, we plan to host special events that will only be available with certain NFT tickets. For example, access to such an event may require first and third place tickets.

Players can sell their NFT tickets, but keep in mind that selling may exclude you from exclusive events. This way, each ticket remains a valuable asset that can be used both to play and to access unique events.

**New hosting: [tonminutes.ru](http://tonminutes.ru)**

We also changed hosting and are now on [tonminutes.ru](http://tonminutes.ru). The platform has been completely migrated and you can continue to enjoy our games and new features on the new site.

**News from TONGrants**

Unfortunately, we were rejected by TONGrants for our platform development grant application. The reason for the refusal is as follows:

> The project idea is great, but at this stage we cannot move forward with your proposal. At this stage of your project, we expect to have some validation of the hypothesis. We encourage you to create a prototype, develop a go-to-market strategy, and begin testing the idea. Also, We‚Äôd like to see a clearer, more visible representation of your relevant experience so we can make sure you have the necessary skills and expertise to deliver this product. Please keep us updated on your continued progress and user acquisition.

We understand the comments of the TONGrants team and take their recommendations into account. We are continuing to work on the prototype and go-to-market strategy, and will present our experience more clearly in future applications. We are not giving up and will be looking for investors elsewhere to accelerate development and offer you even more opportunities on our platform.

Thank you for your support and participation! If you have questions or suggestions, join our [telegram channel](https://t.me/TONMinutes) and [chat](https://t.me/TONMinutes_chat).

**Best regards, TONMinutes team.**

GMCoin is inspired by the concept of earning rewards through self-discipline with the aim of promoting good health habits. Users can participate in self-discipline activities by sleeping, waking up, and eating on time, and they receive rewards for their consistency. If a user misses a check-in, they can revive using TON energy. GMCoin creates a health-focused, self-disciplined community where maintaining discipline leads to wealth.

## [](#project-overview-10)Project Overview

### [](#welcome-to-gmcoin-11)Welcome to GMCoin

With the development of technology, people have more entertainment options in their daily lives. However, excessive entertainment can negatively affect habits. GMCoin is a Web3 application designed to improve this situation. Our vision is to help participants develop good habits‚Äîsuch as going to bed early and eating on time‚Äîwhile providing real rewards.

### [](#challenge-structure-12)Challenge Structure

Each day, GMCoin holds a round of challenges that last for 8 days:

*   **Day 1**: Signup phase (no check-ins required)
*   **Days 2-8**: Challenge phase (5 check-ins per day)

### [](#daily-check-ins-13)Daily Check-ins

Each day‚Äôs challenge consists of 5 check-ins:

*   **GM**: From UTC 07:00 to 07:30
*   **Breakfast**: From UTC 08:30 to 09:00
*   **Lunch**: From UTC 12:00 to 12:30
*   **Dinner**: From UTC 18:00 to 18:30
*   **GN**: From UTC 21:00 to 21:30

Players participate in the challenge by spending $GMC. Each check-in adds an additional 3% of the entry fee to the prize pool, increasing the rewards for a successful challenge.

### [](#participation-and-rewards-14)Participation and Rewards

*   After signing up, players enter a one-day signup phase.
*   During the challenge phase, players must complete five daily check-ins to succeed and move to the next day‚Äôs challenge.
*   After successfully completing a 7-day challenge, rewards are based on the $GMC consumed during signup. The more $GMC consumed, the greater the rewards.
*   Missing a check-in requires expending POWER to make up for it. Failure to complete a check-in results in losing the challenge and forfeiting the accumulated $GMC.

### [](#points-and-rankings-15)Points and Rankings

*   Players have 30 minutes to check-in and earn POINTS.
*   A maximum of 1,800 POINTS can be earned per check-in, with 1 POINT lost for each second of delay.
*   Players are ranked by total POINTS earned, with additional $GMC prizes for the top three players:
    *   **1st place**: 1% of the prize pool (up to 1,000,000 $GMC)
    *   **2nd place**: 0.5% of the prize pool (up to 500,000 $GMC)
    *   **3rd place**: 0.01% of the prize pool (up to 100,000 $GMC)

* * *

## [](#target-audience-16)Target Audience

Our target audience is Telegram and TON users who wish to promote their projects or make a significant impact on the platform. By submitting the form, I confirm that the data provided is accurate, and I fully understand that any discrepancies will result in permanent elimination from The Open League.

Hello,

I‚Äôve only just begun my time with TON, but I started on something that I think will solve all sorts of problems for many. It‚Äôs a feed viewer that can be curated. Connect your wallet and that feeds the rest of the app to load the entire feed, as well as a section for My Live Feed. There are search options to filter, including by address. The data can be exported to json. @'ing handles should create associations on the backend, so eventually I should be able to sort by ‚Äúmost popular‚Äù.

If there‚Äôs interest, I‚Äôll work on a Telegram game where the user mimics creating new passwords by circling their finger on their phone, ‚Äúgenerating randomness‚Äù for passwords.

I‚Äôd love to hear feedback. I am, however, unable to use the API effectively at the moment, I‚Äôm either rate limited or locked out completely.

Thank you for your time and I hope we get to meet together,  
G

Are there any methods to trace the status of external message after sending it to the node?

Except to keep checking the transaction history of the target contract.

# [Cats are liquidity $PRRR | Token and Memecoin battle](/t/cats-are-liquidity-prrr-token-and-memecoin-battle/29042)

[The Open League](/c/the-open-league/56) 

    

[prrrcoin](https://tonresear.ch/u/prrrcoin)   July 17, 2024, 3:36am  1

**Token Name:** Cats are liquidity  
**Ticker:** $PRRR  
**\- Project‚Äôs Twitter:** [@prrrcoin](https://x.com/prrrcoin)

## [](#please-describe-your-project-and-token-utility-1)Please describe your project and token utility

Everyone on the internet loves cats. Everyone knows cats are liquid. So, if cats are liquid, then Memecoin needs cats, blockchain needs cats, the whole crypto space needs cats.

When cats are happy, they make a sound, ‚Äòprrr‚Äô. That‚Äôs why $PRRR will be the sound of happiness on TON.

## [](#please-provide-detailed-information-on-your-token-distribution-especially-indicating-the-of-token-supply-held-by-the-team-and-the-status-of-the-teams-lp-tokens-2)Please provide detailed information on your token distribution, especially indicating the % of token supply held by the team and the status of the team‚Äôs LP tokens

Team hold 14% for now, that use for burn , airdrop , partnership and listing.

## [](#please-describe-your-project-roadmap-for-the-next-6-12-months-3)Please describe your project roadmap for the next 6-12 months

Our project roadmap for the next 6 months is to be as agile as cats. We are building a community and creating memes.

We will airdrop $PRRR to all holders of trending tokens to let everyone know that cats are liquidity.

Currently, we are sending $PRRR to all hot trend tokens on the $TON network. When $PRRR is sent to these tokens, it will be displayed alongside their logo on Tonview, ensuring widespread awareness that cats are liquidity. All meme tokens are being revoked, meaning tokens sent to them are burned and inaccessible. Cats are liquid; cats will soon dominate everywhere.

And you know what will make people more aware of cats are liquidity? We will add liquidity pools with pairs like $PRRR/token to all trending tokens on the $TON space. This way, whenever people search for any hot token, they will see that cats provide liquidity

We are committed to building trust, offering help to others, bringing hope to society, and encouraging people not to lose faith in life or feel disappointed in the world. We treat everyone with sincerity because we hope to bring hope to everyone. We will not force anyone to believe in us, nor will we ask you to do anything you don‚Äôt want to do. We have created a game, and we hope to build a strong community through it to help more people in need. This is the significance of SEED‚Äôs existence, and your participation is our greatest hope at present, while helping you will be our eternal hope. Finally, we wish you all a happy time playing, and we will always be with you, growing continuously, and bringing you hope.

Mnemonics aims to revolutionize the crypto scene by redistributing power from a select few to the wider community. We believe in ‚Äúby Community, for Community, of Community.‚Äù

**Missionüåü**

*   Philosophy: Give crypto-power back to the Community.
*   Goal: Train 1 million hackers and leverage community power to launch and list our token. 1M represents people who agree with our philosophy and values. We believe many more hackers resonate with our mission.
*   Fair Distribution: All tokens will be distributed to enhance our philosophy of community power. All contributors have a fair chance to own tokens.
*   Token Value: Proportional to the strength of the community. More hackers = Bigger community = Higher value.

**Airdrop ![:parachute:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/parachute.png?v=12 ":parachute:")**   
Mnemonics has multiple airdrop plans starting with the ‚Äò1M Contributor Airdrop,‚Äô with a snapshot to be taken very soon. The 1M Snapshot Checker is already released, and many more exciting things are coming.

The airdrop plans are as follows:

1.  1 Million Contributors
2.  BILLS Laundering
3.  Rankings
4.  ETC

Mnemonics‚Äô primary goal is to reward those who have contributed to building our hacker community, allowing as many people as possible to receive rewards and achieve greater earnings.

Mnemonics is currently in discussions for exchange partnerships to ensure the best outcomes. A lot of excitements and announcements are coming very soon! It‚Äôs never late to join the Mnemonics revolution. ![:rocket:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/rocket.png?v=12 ":rocket:")

Enhancing AML Investigations and Compliance on TON: A Proposal by MistTrack

**Introduction**

In the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology, ensuring robust Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures is paramount to fostering trust and security. MistTrack aims to significantly enhance AML investigations on the TON blockchain by developing a comprehensive flow chart that aids in tracking and identifying malicious funds. This initiative will not only bolster compliance efforts but also provide valuable support to exchanges and users within the TON community.

**Importance of Our Initiative**

Strengthening AML Capabilities

As blockchain adoption grows, so does the sophistication of illicit activities. Our initiative seeks to provide a robust framework for AML investigations on the TON blockchain. By creating a detailed flow chart, we aim to streamline the process of identifying and tracking malicious funds, making it easier for investigators to follow the trail of suspicious transactions. This will significantly enhance the ability to prevent and mitigate financial crimes within the TON ecosystem.

Supporting Exchanges and Users with Compliance

Compliance with AML regulations is a critical aspect for exchanges operating within the TON blockchain. MistTrack‚Äôs solution will offer invaluable support by providing a clear and efficient method to track and report suspicious activities. This will not only help exchanges meet regulatory requirements but also protect their reputation and build trust with their users. For individual users, our initiative ensures a safer environment, reducing the risk of inadvertently engaging with illicit activities.

**Benefits to the TON Community**

\-Enhanced Security and Trust

By implementing a comprehensive AML investigation framework, we contribute to creating a more secure and trustworthy TON ecosystem. Enhanced security measures will attract more users and businesses to the TON blockchain, fostering growth and innovation.

\-Compliance and Regulatory Assurance

With increased regulatory scrutiny on cryptocurrencies, our initiative provides the TON community with the tools necessary to stay compliant with global AML standards. This proactive approach will ensure that TON remains a leader in regulatory adherence, minimizing the risk of sanctions and penalties.

\-Community Empowerment

Our initiative empowers the TON community by providing them with the knowledge and tools to detect and prevent financial crimes. By fostering a collaborative environment where exchanges, users, and investigators can work together, we create a united front against illicit activities.

Conclusion

Our proposal to develop a flow chart for AML investigations on the TON blockchain represents a significant step towards enhancing security and compliance within the ecosystem. By supporting exchanges and users in tracking and reporting suspicious activities, we aim to build a safer and more trustworthy TON community. We believe that our initiative aligns with TON‚Äôs commitment to innovation and security, and we look forward to contributing to the continued growth and success of the TON blockchain.

We invite the TON community to support our proposal and join us in our mission to enhance AML capabilities and compliance on the TON blockchain. Together, we can create a secure and thriving environment for all.

We are committed to building trust, being willing to offer help to others, bringing hope to society, and encouraging people not to lose faith in life or feel disappointed in the world. We treat everyone with sincerity because we hope to bring hope to everyone. We will not force anyone to believe in us, nor will we ask you to do anything you are unwilling to do. We have created a game and hope to build a strong community through it to help more people in need. This is the significance of SEED‚Äôs existence, and your participation will be our greatest hope at present, while helping you will always be our hope. Finally, we wish you all have fun playing, and we will always be by your side, growing continuously, and bringing you hope.

# [](#introduction-1)Introduction

Due to the various applications that Rebase Tokens can achieve, I began to delve into this technology. At the same time, I noticed discussions on [implementing Rebase Tokens on TON](https://github.com/ton-society/grants-and-bounties/issues/342) last year. By reading [this TON research](https://tonresear.ch/t/tep-130-optimizing-token-mechanics-introducing-the-rebase-jetton-standard/156), I understood the requirements and challenges of implementing Rebase Tokens on TON.

In the following content, we will discuss the Rebase Token implementation methods mentioned in this article and share my proposed improvements.

# [](#overview-of-rebase-token-2)Overview of Rebase Token

We won‚Äôt go into a detailed introduction of Rebase Tokens, but it can be understood that periodically, the token supply needs to undergo a rebase adjustment. While the number of shares each user holds remains constant, their balance will fluctuate, ensuring the token‚Äôs price stays within a certain range. Additionally, this rebase mechanism can be used to generate Yield Bearing Tokens.

For example, let‚Äôs consider [Lido](https://lido.fi/):

Suppose Bob holds 10 stETH, and the current total ETH in Lido is 1000 ETH, with a total of 1000 shares.

Bob‚Äôs share can be calculated using the following formula:

```
shares[account] = balanceOf(account) * totalShares / totalSupply
```

For Bob, the calculation would be:

```
Bob's shares = 10 * 1000 / 1000 = 10 (shares)
```

Suppose after one day, Lido receives a 10% reward, increasing the total ETH to 1100 ETH. The value of Bob‚Äôs 10 shares would also increase accordingly:

```
10 * 1100 / 1000 = 11 ETH
```

In this way, automatic compounding is achieved, which is a Yield Bearing Token. Implementing this on Ethereum is relatively straightforward. However, on TON, the implementation complexity increases due to the distinction between Jetton Master and Jetton Wallet contracts.

# [](#tep-130-3)TEP 130

The following section will discuss the currently proposed [TEP 130](https://github.com/ton-society/grants-and-bounties/issues/342) on TON. For a detailed introduction to this TEP, you can refer to [this article](https://united-finance.medium.com/overview-of-ways-to-implement-rebase-tokens-on-ton-blockchain-3e23552cf0b3). We will start by introducing the interaction between the frontend and the on-chain contracts, as described in the article, and then discuss the on-chain interaction version proposed by TEP 130.

## [](#frontend-integration-4)Frontend Integration

[![rebase_example1](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/1/168c4537e7b3f71251abfa7518703d9b35a9b47d_2_690x298.png)

](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/original/2X/1/168c4537e7b3f71251abfa7518703d9b35a9b47d.png "rebase_example1")

When displaying Pool information on the frontend, `get_balances()` is used to convert shares into balances. As shown in the figure, 10 rTON actually represents 80 shares (assuming 1 rTON = 8 shares).

However, when interacting with the blockchain, balances need to be converted into shares. Therefore, if Bob wants to exchange 2 rTON for USDT, the frontend will first use `get_jetton_shares()` to convert 2 rTON into 16 shares, and then transfer these 16 shares to the pool to execute the asset exchange.

From the example in the article, it is clear that directly using shares for on-chain calculations and converting shares and balances on the frontend is not overly complicated. Simply converting the jetton wallet‚Äôs balance into shares and adding some functionality can achieve this operation.

## [](#full-integration-5)Full integration

If Rebase tokens are only interacted with through the frontend, it is clearly insufficient. Therefore, the author proposed an on-chain interaction version for [Ston.fi](http://Ston.fi). The specific details are as follows:

The example provided by the author is somewhat confusing because the first example uses `shares` to run the constant product formula. Theoretically, this approach is feasible. Users transfer USDT to the Router, and the Pool only needs to calculate the received USDT. Using the `x * y = k` formula, it can similarly determine how many `shares` should be transferred to the user. It does not seem necessary to call the `Jetton Minter` to convert `shares` into `balance` or `balances` into `shares`. The author might be suggesting that if such conversions are needed, it would add an additional 5 transactions.

Therefore, I thought of another example to illustrate the need for converting shares and balances on-chain: when Rebase tokens are used as collateral. In such a situation, it might be necessary to know how much balance the current share represents and then calculate its actual value through an oracle to determine if liquidation is needed.

From the TEP 130 discussion thread and the final implementation of the Rebase Jetton by the author, it is clear that they have removed this method. Thus, the proposed standard does not support on-chain `shares ‚Üí balance` or `balances ‚Üí shares` operations. The reason for this removal could be that obtaining conversion results through messaging could lead to data expiration issues and high transaction fees. This problem is also mentioned in the [discussion thread](https://github.com/ton-society/grants-and-bounties/issues/342#issuecomment-1801172994).

## [](#challenges-6)Challenges

Based on the current TEP 130 proposal, Rebase Tokens on TON can only be converted via the frontend and then interact with on-chain protocols through shares. This is clearly insufficient, as there are situations where on-chain operations also need to know the current balances represented by the shares. For example, in the aforementioned case of liquidation in a lending protocol, it is necessary to know the balances represented by the collateralized shares to calculate their value.

Dr. Awesome Doge in the TON Research [article](https://tonresear.ch/t/tep-130-optimizing-token-mechanics-introducing-the-rebase-jetton-standard/156) also mentioned that the current TEP 130 proposal lacks an on-chain interaction version.

Therefore, it is evident that the current Rebase Token standard has significant room for improvement.

From the on-chain solution proposed in TEP 130, we can identify two main issues:

1.  The transaction fees for obtaining conversion results from the Jetton Master whenever `shares` and `balances` need to be converted are too high.
2.  There is no clear specification for the validity period of the messages, making it difficult to ensure the accuracy of the Rebase information obtained.

To address these issues, I propose a new solution:

*   Protocols can send a `RequestRebaseInfo` message to the Jetton Master according to the rebase cycle. For example, Lido performs a rebase every 24 hours, so on TON, a `RequestRebaseInfo` message can be sent every 24 hours, resulting in minimal transaction fees.
*   The Rebase Jetton Master should include two additional variables besides `total_supply` and `total_shares`:
    *   `rebase_time`: The start time of this rebase cycle.
    *   `rebase_interval`: The length of the rebase cycle.
    *   The next rebase trigger time would be `rebase_time` + `rebase_interval`.
*   Protocols can also check the validity of the Rebase information during user interactions with the contract. If the information is outdated, a `RequestRebaseInfo` message is sent to the Jetton Master to update the Rebase information.
*   Upon receiving a `RequestRebaseInfo` message, the Jetton Master will send a `ProvideRebaseInfo` message to the Protocols, which includes:
    *   `total_supply`: coins
    *   `total_share`: coins
    *   `expiration`: uint32

*   Upon receiving the `ProvideRebaseInfo` message, the protocols will update the corresponding four variables in the contract.
*   After updating the rebase parameters, protocols can directly perform conversions between shares and balances within the contract based on `total_supply` and `total_share`. Users no longer need to send conversion messages to the Jetton Master during interactions.
*   In addition to `total_supply` and `total_share`, the Jetton Master will also provide `expiration`. The protocol‚Äôs contract can use `now()` to determine if the current rebase information is still valid.  
    
    [![image](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/4/492aca7b8ed9b478177fc422f737dcc8eee12804_2_690x407.jpeg)

By using this method, the issue of having to send messages to the Jetton Master each time for `shares` and `balances` conversion confirmation during on-chain interactions can be resolved. If the rebase cycle is once a day, the protocols only need to pay the fee once on behalf of the users. Consequently, each user can save the 5 transactions required by TEP 130. Assuming there are 10 transactions related to the Rebase Token in a day, this would save 5 \* 10 = 50 transactions.

Regarding issue 2, obtaining rebase information from the Jetton Master may face expiration issues, which is why the contract cannot call the `get_method` on the wallet. However, through the `expiration` variable, the correctness of the rebase information can be confirmed. Additionally, rebase information is updated periodically, unlike wallet balances that may change at any time. Therefore, this method can provide reliable information.

# [](#conclusion-8)Conclusion

Based on the characteristics of Rebase Tokens, an expiration variable has been added to prevent the use of outdated rebase information. The `total_supply` and `total_shares` parameters are updated by sending a `RequestRebaseInfo` message from the protocols and receiving the `ProvideRebaseInfo` message. Given the design of the rebase mechanism, signaling according to the rebase cycle should not impose a significant burden on the protocols, yet it can save users substantial fees.

This article does not cover how to update the `total_supply` and `total_share` in the Jetton Master, as this aspect is closely related to the design of the Rebase Token itself. It might involve updating parameters via `JettonNotification` and then updating `total_supply` and `total_share` after the rebase cycle completes. This discussion will be reserved for a future article. My proof of concept implementation can be found at [this link](https://github.com/ipromise2324/Rebase-Jetton). I hope developers on TON can join the discussion on how to implement Rebase Tokens and make them a reality on TON.

GameFi, or gaming finance, is a rapidly evolving trend in the cryptocurrency space, gaining traction among both players and investors. With the integration of Telegram and the TON blockchain, this trend is being further propelled, as these platforms aim to capitalize on the burgeoning interest in gaming within the crypto ecosystem.

## [](#p-44766-telegram-and-ton-a-new-era-for-gamefi-1)Telegram and TON: A New Era for GameFi

Telegram, with its vast user base of approximately 800 million, provides a unique distribution channel for games. Instead of relying on traditional app stores like the App Store or Google Play, games can be launched directly within the Telegram app using the Telegram Web Apps (TWA) API. This seamless integration allows for a smoother user experience and better retention rates, leveraging existing Web2 user acquisition tools

The TON blockchain enhances this experience by offering a fast and cost-effective solution, capable of processing over 1 million transactions per second with minimal fees. This efficiency is critical for gaming applications, where quick transactions are often necessary for gameplay and in-game purchases.

## [](#p-44766-the-role-of-ton-play-2)The Role of TON Play

Among the key players in this ecosystem is TON Play, which focuses on developing gaming experiences within Telegram. This initiative supports traditional game developers in transitioning to mini-apps and is actively creating engaging games. Notable figures behind TON Play include:

*   **Mikhail Gavrilov**: A prominent figure in the TON community, known for his advocacy and presentations.
    
*   **Andrei Rogozov**: Former CEO of VKontakte and a close associate of Pavel Durov, he leads The Open Platform, which plays a significant role in TON Play‚Äôs development.
    
*   **MEXC Global**: This investment fund has contributed $4 million to the project, underscoring the serious backing behind TON Play.
    

## [](#p-44766-innovations-in-gamefi-3)Innovations in GameFi

Recently, TON Play launched the [Play Deck](https://t.me/playdeckbot?start=bnJfNjEyNjY3NTg3Mw==), a comprehensive marketplace for games within Telegram. This platform offers a variety of game genres, from casual tap games to complex strategy games. Players can engage in leagues, referral systems, and even farm native tokens, such as PlayCoin ($PDCK), by playing games or completing quests.

The [Play Deck](https://t.me/playdeckbot?start=bnJfNjEyNjY3NTg3Mw==) not only facilitates gameplay but also introduces monetization opportunities through in-game tokens, NFTs, and partnerships with advertisers. Quests within the games often intersect with external advertising tasks, indicating a robust model for revenue generation and community engagement.

## [](#p-44766-conclusion-4)Conclusion

The convergence of gaming and finance on platforms like Telegram and TON is setting the stage for a new wave of GameFi innovations. With significant investment and a clear strategy for user engagement and retention, TON Play is poised to lead this charge, making gaming more accessible and integrated within the broader cryptocurrency landscape. As the ecosystem continues to evolve, it will be essential to monitor how these developments shape the future of gaming in the digital economy.

# [What's the typical pattern of error handling and reporting to frontend in a multi-contract interaction?](/t/whats-the-typical-pattern-of-error-handling-and-reporting-to-frontend-in-a-multi-contract-interaction/29651)

[General](/c/general/4) 

[learn](https://tonresear.ch/tag/learn)

    

[YakovL](https://tonresear.ch/u/YakovL)  August 1, 2024, 10:05am  1

Let‚Äôs say I have a contract `A` that‚Äôs supposed to be called from the frontend (DApp/TWA), and the full interaction involves several contracts: `A` calls `B`, `C`, `D`, and `C` again. It‚Äôs desirable to report on frontend whether the whole ‚Äúsaga‚Äù was successful. Is this feasible in TON without extra means (like backend/indexing APIs)?

```
 A ‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì> B     C     D
 |      *     |     |
 | <‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì |     |     |
 *      |     |     |
 | ‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì> |     |
 |      |     *     |
 | <‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì |     |  // this may be missing if C is third-party
 *      |     |     |
 | ---------------> |
 |      |     |     *
 | <--------------- |
 *      |     |     |
 | ‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì> |     |
 |      |     *     |
 | <‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì |     |  // this may be missing if C is third-party
 *      |     |     |
```

The complication I see is that once `A` calls `B`, the initial tx from the user‚Äôs wallet is finished, and the rest of the process is done in new txs (tx 2: `B` recieves msg from `A`, computes, and sends another msg to `A`), which can‚Äôt bounce ‚Äúback to wallet‚Äù, while in each compute point (`*` on the diagram) errors may take place. I‚Äôm aware that one can send and resend the same `query_id` for all the messages of this ‚Äúsaga‚Äù, but what‚Äôs the typical approach to error handling, especially when, say, contract `C` is a third-party one?

I‚Äôve checked the [article](https://blog.ton.org/how-to-shard-your-ton-smart-contract-and-why-studying-the-anatomy-of-tons-jettons) by Tal Kol that explains contract sharding and followed ‚ÄúUser story 1‚Äù (sending Jetton), but the code is not self-explanatory: (ok, let‚Äôs skip the external messages stuff) what does the ‚Äúrevert on errors‚Äù [comment](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/main/ft/jetton-wallet.fc#L96) mean? In my tests, if `send_raw_message` fails on the action phase, the code after it still computes (and that‚Äôs understandable, as it‚Äôs executed during the compute phase).

Basically my question is: how can I ‚Äúcollect‚Äù the results and ‚Äúreport‚Äù them on frontend (i.e. distinguish ‚Äúpending‚Äù, ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù, and ‚Äúfailure‚Äù states)? In sandbox (Blueprint autotests), it‚Äôs simple: each `send_` method of a `SandboxContract` returns a full log containing all the txs and events in the chain of interactions, but is there something similar available for frontend?

More specifically, it seems that saga is not needed (in Jetton), so how the possible errors are handled and reported instead?

PS Another related question is: if `C` doesn‚Äôt send specific responses on success, but I need to send message to `D` _after_ the message to `C` is successfully processed, can I still somehow do that?

[YakovL](https://tonresear.ch/u/YakovL) August 1, 2024, 2:04pm  2

Alright, looks like I‚Äôve found the answer to the first part of the question.

For frontend we have at least 2 APIs: [toncenter](https://toncenter.com/api/v3/) (`/transactions` and `/transactionsByMessage`) and [tonconsole](https://docs.tonconsole.com/tonapi/api-v2) (`/v2/blockchain/transactions/{tx_id}` and `/v2/blockchain/messages/{msg_id}/transaction`) which allow to see messages of a tx, and then find next txs by those messages, and get the whole chain using those. Note: I haven‚Äôt used this in production yet, only checked that the APIs allow to get the chain of messages and txs on a live mainnet example.

\===

But I still don‚Äôt understand how to handle the case when I need a ‚Äúsaga‚Äù, i.e. call `D` after `C`, but only if tx to `C` succeeds (and given that `C` doesn‚Äôt send any specific response). What I do understand is that I can set the `bounce` flag to the `A ‚Üí C` message, but that only allows (I‚Äôm not sure if it works in 100% cases) to get a message with the `bounced` flag (and hopefully the same `query_id`) _if the tx fails_. However, I need a way to send to `D` _only if and after_ the tx on `C` _succeeds_. Is there any way to do that?

Dear community members!

SeedsofTON has completed its closed beta testing phase, and we are currently working on resolving some performance issues that arose during the testing process, including floating text effects, user interface (UI) display errors, and other minor issues.

Once these issues are resolved, we will officially launch the product.

Please continue to follow our channels and community announcements for the latest information on the release date.

*   TON CAT (TCAT) is a community token that aims to onboard and educate new users and investors about the TON blockchain.
    

TCAT launched on GAS.PUMP the pump fun of the ton chain, up until July 1st the token was managed by a sole community member who contacted @thekryptoking a ton KOL to take over the token.

TCAT is based on a PPP model, with a focus on building community long-term instead of quick personal gains. TCAT has had daily AMAs for 32 days straight, and we haven‚Äôt missed a day. We have also sponsored a $10,000 community giveaway to help new TON creators with 45 new creators making daily content to help onboard new users to the network and educate people around TON Blockchain.

*   Total supply: 988,160,477.1477056 TCAT. Tokens

Use case: The TCAT Takeover team has developed an ‚Äòinterstellar bot‚Äô a trending channel, a buy alert bot and a sniper bot. All profits from this will go to buyback and burns of the TCAT token: [https://www.interstellar.bot/  
](https://www.interstellar.bot/)LP Locked and burnt: This token was launched on GAS.PUMP TCAT has no access to the LP pool or Contract - LP was burnt: [Tonscan ‚Äî Explore TON blockchain ecosystem](https://tonscan.org/address/UQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJKZ)

## [](#p-45194-projects-message-2)Project‚Äôs Message

Currently, Bitcoin is no longer truly decentralized. It is largely held by investment funds, large  
economic organizations, and wealthy individuals. They use Bitcoin as a trump card to  
manipulate the entire cryptocurrency market and always find ways to take money from  
inexperienced and small investors; even those with many years of experience cannot  
escape this manipulation.  
Why should the entire crypto market be dependent on and controlled by Bitcoin?  
We, users, supporters, investors, crypto and blockchain developers, are tired of this and  
wish for a new cryptocurrency platform to replace Bitcoin.  
NotBitcoin is distributed for free to everyone, offering a new opportunity, a fresh breeze we  
want to bring to everyone, especially small investors who do not have much money

These videos will provide insights into the development process of SmartLitre, our mission, and the impact we aim to create globally.

We are excited to share that we are in the process of submitting our application for Telegram Apps Moderation. This step is crucial for ensuring the quality and performance of our mini-app on the Telegram platform. We are committed to providing an outstanding user experience and meeting the high standards set by Telegram.

In addition to Telegram Apps Moderation, we are in the process of applying for support from the Marketing team of the TON Foundation. This includes requesting strategic guidance, content creation, and budget allocations for major campaigns. We believe that with their support, we can effectively promote SmartLitre and engage our community. Another exciting development is our application for featuring in the Trending Apps Center. Being featured in this center would provide significant exposure for SmartLitre, helping us reach a broader audience and showcase our unique approach to hydration and global impact.

**Join Us on This Journey**  
As we count down to the launch, we invite you to join us on this journey. Subscribe to our [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@smartlitre?feature=shared), engage with our content, and become a part of the SmartLitre community. Together, we can revolutionize hydration and make a meaningful difference in the world.

Hey!  
I guess it‚Äôs a great option for content creators to receive their tips. However, I wonder, how you would compete with Telegram Stars system.

 

[Joey\_Xie](https://tonresear.ch/u/Joey_Xie) August 15, 2024, 6:45am  3

It‚Äôs my first time heard of Telegram stars, thans for the information. I think the differences are:

1.  Stars are used to pay for product, but blog content is not a product, readers can tip at will.
2.  TipTon is a js plugin, you can embed it in any website, not restricted in telegram mini app

# [TON Wallet Integration with ton-ui-vue for vue/nuxt](/t/ton-wallet-integration-with-ton-ui-vue-for-vue-nuxt/30160)

[General](/c/general/4)

As blockchain technology continues to grow, integrating TON wallets into web applications is becoming increasingly important. For Vue.js and Nuxt.js developers, **ton-ui-vue** offers a powerful solution for seamlessly connecting TON wallets with your projects. This guide will walk you through the setup, usage, and advanced features of ton-ui-vue, ensuring you can leverage its full potential.

#### [](#p-45812-why-use-ton-ui-vue-1)Why Use ton-ui-vue?

**ton-ui-vue** is designed to simplify the process of integrating TON wallets into your Vue.js applications. It provides a set of pre-built components, hooks, and customizable interfaces that make it easy to add wallet functionality without dealing with the complexities of blockchain technology. The package is also fully compatible with Nuxt.js, allowing you to maintain wallet connections in server-side rendered applications.

#### [](#p-45812-getting-started-with-ton-ui-vue-2)Getting Started with ton-ui-vue

##### [](#p-45812-installation-3)Installation

To begin using ton-ui-vue, install it using npm or yarn:

```
npm install ton-ui-vue @tonconnect/ui
# or
yarn add ton-ui-vue @tonconnect/ui
```

##### [](#p-45812-basic-setup-4)Basic Setup

Once installed, create the `TonConnectUIProvider` in your `main.ts` file to provide the necessary contexts for your app:

```
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';
import {
    createTonConnectUIProvider,
    TonConnectUIContext,
    TonConnectUIOptionsContext
} from 'ton-ui-vue';

const { tonConnectUI, setOptions } = createTonConnectUIProvider({
    manifestUrl: 'https://your-manifest-url'
});

const app = createApp(App);

app.provide(TonConnectUIContext, tonConnectUI);
app.provide(TonConnectUIOptionsContext, setOptions);

app.mount('#app');
```

This setup enables your application to easily connect with TON wallets using the provided context.

##### [](#p-45812-using-the-connect-button-5)Using the Connect Button

Adding a connect button to your application is straightforward with the `TonConnectButton` component:

Hi, please help with the tone of the sites.  
The problem is that for some reason Apple devices work extremely poorly. Cookies do not hold and because of this it is impossible to place an order, write a review, enter a captcha, remove notifications, and so on. Has anyone encountered such a problem? Help solve it, we are ready to pay hourly for help.

And on Mac OS, it is completely impossible to enter either a login or password for authorization, because the site opens in the mobile version and for some reason there is no keyboard, it does not load.

Help please.

I tested TMA locally by React project, so that I can get the information of mine using ‚Äúwindow.Telegram.WebApp.initDataUnsafe.user‚Äù.

And I‚Äôm trying to uae tdlib by python flask.

Check the user‚Äôs information on the frontend first, and then request the api using the information to get user‚Äôs account creation date and another.

Is it possible?

In the evolving world of cryptocurrency, airdrops have become a popular method for projects to distribute tokens, create buzz, and engage potential users. However, a significant issue plaguing this system is the rampant abuse by Sybil attackers‚Äîindividuals who create multiple accounts to farm airdrops. This manipulation not only skews the effectiveness of these campaigns but also undermines the fairness intended for genuine participants. One of the most problematic platforms for such abuse is Telegram, where creating and managing multiple accounts is relatively easy. To address this challenge, a practical solution involves implementing Know Your Customer (KYC) verification for Telegram wallets participating in airdrops.

_**Understanding the Sybil Problem in Airdrops**_

Sybil attacks, where individuals use multiple fake identities to gain an unfair advantage, are particularly problematic in the context of airdrops. These attacks result in:

1.  **Inflated Participation Numbers:** Projects are often misled by inflated participant numbers, which can distort the perceived success of an airdrop and lead to misguided marketing strategies.
    
2.  **Wasted Resources:** Airdrop budgets and resources are squandered on fake or duplicate accounts rather than reaching genuine users who could add real value to the project.
    
3.  **Decreased Effectiveness:** The intended purpose of airdrops‚Äîto foster community engagement and reward early adopters‚Äîis undermined when the majority of participants are not genuine.
    

**Why Telegram Airdrops Are Vulnerable**

Telegram, with its ease of account creation and anonymity, is a prime target for Sybil attacks. Users can create numerous accounts with little to no verification, allowing them to exploit airdrop opportunities across multiple fake identities. This makes it difficult for projects to distinguish between genuine participants and those exploiting the system.

**Proposed Solution: KYC Verification for Telegram Wallets**

To mitigate the impact of Sybil attacks and ensure a fairer distribution of airdrop tokens, implementing KYC (Know Your Customer) verification for Telegram wallets could be an effective strategy. Here‚Äôs how this could work:

1.  **Mandatory KYC Verification:** Only Telegram wallets that have completed KYC verification would be eligible to claim airdrops. This process would involve users submitting identity verification documents to establish the authenticity of their accounts.
    
2.  **Whitelist Eligible Wallets:** Once a Telegram wallet passes the KYC process, it would be whitelisted for claiming airdrops. This whitelist ensures that only verified accounts participate, reducing the potential for Sybil attacks.
    
3.  **Post-Airdrop Transfers:** After receiving the airdrop tokens, users could freely transfer the tokens to any exchange of their choice. This step maintains the liquidity and usability of the tokens while ensuring that the initial claim is made by verified users.
    

**Benefits of the KYC-Based Approach**

1.  **Increased Fairness:** By ensuring that only verified accounts can claim airdrops, the system becomes more equitable, rewarding genuine users rather than those exploiting the system.
    
2.  **Improved Accuracy:** Projects receive more accurate participation data, allowing them to better gauge the effectiveness of their airdrop campaigns and make more informed decisions.
    
3.  **Enhanced Security:** KYC verification adds a layer of security, reducing the likelihood of fraud and abuse in the airdrop process.
    
4.  **Building Trust:** This approach can enhance trust in the airdrop process, making it more appealing for legitimate users who may have been discouraged by past abuses.
    

**Implementation Considerations**

1.  **Privacy Concerns:** Projects must ensure that KYC processes comply with data protection regulations and that user privacy is safeguarded.
    
2.  **User Experience:** The KYC process should be streamlined to avoid discouraging genuine users due to lengthy or complicated verification procedures.
    
3.  **Cost and Resources:** Implementing KYC verification requires resources for both the verification process and ongoing management. Projects need to assess the feasibility and allocate budgets accordingly.
    

_**Conclusion**_

Sybil attacks present a significant challenge to the fairness and effectiveness of crypto airdrops, especially on platforms like Telegram. Implementing KYC verification for Telegram wallets could offer a robust solution to this problem, ensuring that airdrops reach genuine users and maintaining the integrity of the distribution process. While there are challenges to consider, the benefits of a more equitable and secure airdrop system could outweigh the costs, paving the way for a more trustworthy and effective method of engaging with the cryptocurrency community.

You are correct about people in crypto not wanting a KYC but to help with even distribution i think that is the only way‚Ä¶Except the tonchain will have to device a technology that can help identify individuals who interact with the TON ecosystem as an individual no matter how many wallets or accounts they create.

I think this is the best approach so far

And why won‚Äôt people agree to this type of kyc?

And also Telegram is more of web2 app

In short

If you‚Äôre ensured to do kyc on CEX I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs stopping telegram from doing the same

# [Advanced Tooling for TON Blockchain Operations: A Technical Insight](/t/advanced-tooling-for-ton-blockchain-operations-a-technical-insight/303)

[Application](/c/application/20) 

    

[ASURADA](https://tonresear.ch/u/ASURADA)   February 6, 2024, 10:59am  1

The TON (The Open Network) blockchain represents a significant advancement in the landscape of digital ledgers, offering unique opportunities for developers and network operators. This article provides an in-depth analysis of a suite of tools designed to enhance interaction with the TON network, detailed in a repository that serves as a cornerstone for developers working within this ecosystem. The repository in question is a comprehensive collection of scripts and utilities aimed at facilitating various operations related to the TON blockchain.

**Repository Overview**

The repository houses a diverse array of tools tailored for the TON Network. These tools are essential for developers, node operators, and anyone engaged with TON blockchain operations. The focus here is on Python scripts, which necessitate specific libraries, namely `pyTON` and `tvm-valuetypes`, to function correctly.

**Node-Related Utilities**

A critical aspect of blockchain operations involves node management. The repository offers several Python scripts and shell utilities under the `/node` path designed to simplify node operations. The utilities are grouped into categories based on their functionality, as described in the table below:

Utility Category

Description

Tools

IP Conversion

Facilitates the conversion between decimal and IPV4 formats for IP addresses, supporting both positive and negative decimals.

`dec2ip.py`, `ip2dec.py`

Key Files Conversion

Converts key files into a base64 format for use in configuration files.

`key2b64.py`

Config Generators

Scripts to generate JSON structures for various node configuration needs, including validator/console setups and lite server listeners.

`mkcontrol.sh`, `mklite.sh`, `mkpub_dht.sh`

Services

Provides example control scripts for managing TON nodes and DHT servers, including support for multiple node instances on a single host.

DaemonTools `run` files

**Site-Related Tools**

For those working on site development or maintenance within the TON ecosystem, the repository includes a tool for ADNL (Abstract Data Networking Layer) query resolution. This utility, `adnl_resolve.py`, interfaces with DHT servers to resolve ADNL addresses into IP and port combinations, requiring the `dht-resolve` binary from the TON source tree.

**Wallet Tools**

Managing and interacting with wallets is a fundamental aspect of blockchain operations. The repository provides a utility, `parse_addr.py`, designed to parse wallet address files, returning information in both human-readable and JSON formats. This tool is invaluable for developers requiring detailed insights into wallet address configurations.

**Conclusion**

The repository offers a vital resource for the TON blockchain community, providing a range of tools that streamline operations, enhance node management, and facilitate wallet interactions. By leveraging these tools, developers and node operators can achieve more efficient and effective engagement with the TON blockchain, ensuring smoother operations and a more robust network.

The ongoing development and refinement of these tools underscore the community‚Äôs commitment to making the TON blockchain more accessible and manageable for a broad spectrum of users. As the TON ecosystem continues to evolve, the availability of such advanced tooling will play a crucial role in its growth and sustainability.

# [Leveraging FreeBSD for TON Blockchain Node Operations: A Comprehensive Guide](/t/leveraging-freebsd-for-ton-blockchain-node-operations-a-comprehensive-guide/304)

[Application](/c/application/20) 

    

[ASURADA](https://tonresear.ch/u/ASURADA)   February 6, 2024, 11:13am  1

The The Open Network (TON) blockchain is a rapidly evolving platform, offering a new horizon for decentralized applications and services. While Linux has traditionally been the go-to environment for blockchain node operations, there‚Äôs a growing interest in exploring alternative operating systems, such as FreeBSD, for these tasks. This article delves into a detailed guide designed to facilitate the deployment of TON blockchain nodes‚Äîboth full nodes and validators‚Äîon FreeBSD systems, catering to the unique requirements of this operating system.

**Introduction to FreeBSD and TON Blockchain**

FreeBSD is renowned for its robustness, advanced networking, security features, and performance, making it an attractive option for running blockchain nodes. The guide in focus provides a comprehensive walkthrough for setting up TON nodes on FreeBSD, aiming at the Newton Blockchain Testnet but applicable to other blockchains as well.

**Rationale for FreeBSD Adoption**

The motivation behind this guide is the scarcity of resources and ready-made solutions for deploying TON Blockchain nodes on FreeBSD. Most existing resources cater to Linux users, with a significant emphasis on Docker containers. However, for enthusiasts and professionals preferring FreeBSD, these solutions fall short. This guide fills this gap, offering tailored instructions for FreeBSD users.

**Guide Status and Future Developments**

Currently, the guide is a work in progress, with plans for substantial enhancements, including the development of a full binary package for FreeBSD. This future package aims to streamline the installation process, negating the need for manual compilation and installation. Additionally, there‚Äôs an ongoing effort to adapt the mytonctrl tool for FreeBSD, traditionally designed with a Linux focus.

**Guide Content Overview**

The guide is structured into several key sections, each targeting a specific aspect of TON node operation on FreeBSD:

Section

Description

Installation Guide

Details the process for building, installing, and launching TON binaries on FreeBSD systems.

Full Node Configuration

Outlines the steps to configure a TON network full node.

Validator Node Configuration

Provides guidance on setting up a TON network validator node.

DHT Server Configuration

Discusses configuring a TON network DHT server.

FAQ

Addresses frequently asked questions regarding TON on FreeBSD and other systems.

**Conclusion**

This guide serves as an essential resource for blockchain enthusiasts and professionals looking to leverage the power and flexibility of FreeBSD for TON node operations. It not only bridges the knowledge gap for FreeBSD users but also highlights the platform‚Äôs potential in hosting blockchain technologies. As the guide evolves, it promises to offer a more streamlined and accessible pathway for deploying TON nodes on FreeBSD, further diversifying the ecosystem and supporting the growth of the TON blockchain.

Through detailed instructions and continuous updates, this guide stands as a testament to the community‚Äôs dedication to expanding TON blockchain‚Äôs accessibility and operability across different operating systems, ensuring a broader range of users can participate in and contribute to its network.

In my past experience, operating TON blockchain nodes in Free BSD will be much more efficient. I once operated TON in Free BSD to achieve twice the speed.

# [How launch airdrop of your jetton token project?](/t/how-launch-airdrop-of-your-jetton-token-project/30449)

[General](/c/general/4) 

    

[Konstantin](https://tonresear.ch/u/Konstantin)  September 3, 2024, 9:43am  1

We have created a ready-to-use solution for jetton projects that want to use airdrop as a marketing tool to promote their token on the TON network.  
This is when a project launches a new Jetton token and wants to start an airdrop for those who subscribe to the project‚Äôs chats and groups in Telegram.  
Even after the token generation event, it will be possible to distribute the token to airdrop recipients via our solution. On-chain claim Jetton tokens of the project will be available to them.  
If you have any questions about the project, please contact support - we will be happy to help you promptly.

As the Ton community growing everyday,a new airdrop game rise afterward which it spreads the community into multiple games.after a couple of months we would have lots of coins listed on the market.so what we get in the market?most likely low worth coins which traders rush to sell them at the highest rate at the begging getting low profit out of it ![:hot_face:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/hot_face.png?v=12 ":hot_face:") and the rate goes low and low due to high supply.  
What can we do?  
As a HUGE society we may better to focus on 1 single airdrop game every 6 month to get the highest potential profit out of 1 single coin in the market.  
Together we rise,together we punch

Traditional mining pools, though popular, may not appeal to all, especially those with significant hashing power and a preference for solo mining. This article introduces a groundbreaking framework designed for TON blockchain mining that enables solo operations without the need for joining a mining pool, detailed through a repository that offers a comprehensive solution for decentralized mining.

**Framework Overview**

This TON mining framework is a sophisticated suite comprising two main components designed to facilitate solo mining operations through a centralized server. This server orchestrates the distribution of Proof of Work (PoW) giver parameters to individual miners or slaves, alongside the targets (wallets) for mining. The primary goal is to enable miners with substantial hashing power (250+ GH/s recommended) to operate independently of mining pools, leveraging the framework‚Äôs capabilities for efficient solo mining.

**Component Breakdown**

The mining framework is structured around two core scripts, each serving a distinct role in the solo mining process:

Component

Function

`server.py`

Acts as the centralized server, distributing almost real-time PoW giver parameters and mining targets to the miners.

`miner.py`

Represents the actual mining process executed on nodes equipped with GPUs, performing the cryptographic calculations necessary for mining TON coins.

**Prerequisites for Setup**

To deploy and utilize this mining framework effectively, several prerequisites must be met, ensuring that the mining operation runs smoothly and efficiently:

*   **TON Node Binaries:** Essential for the operation, available from the Newton Blockchain GitHub repository.
*   **Lite-client Configuration:** A valid configuration file or key is crucial to establish connectivity with the lite-server.
*   **OpenCL Installation:** Required for GPU-based mining processes, facilitating the computational tasks performed by the miner.
*   **Config File Adjustment:** Proper configuration is vital, with template files provided within the repository to guide users in setting up their mining environment.

**Operational Testing**

Ensuring the framework‚Äôs components are correctly set up and operational involves conducting tests on both the server and miner components:

*   **Server Testing:** Verifying the server‚Äôs functionality can be as simple as checking for JSON data output when accessing the server‚Äôs IP/port via an HTTP connection.
*   **Miner Testing:** For the miner, initial tests involve identifying OpenCL devices/platforms and executing a test run to validate the setup‚Äôs effectiveness in finding potential solutions.

**Conclusion**

This solo mining framework for the TON blockchain marks a significant step towards decentralizing mining efforts, providing a viable alternative for miners with the capability to operate independently of pools. By offering a detailed guide on setting up and testing each component of the framework, miners are equipped with the necessary tools to embark on solo mining ventures, harnessing their computing power to contribute to the TON blockchain while optimizing their potential rewards.

This article transforms the technical details of the TON mining framework into an accessible and structured guide, highlighting the framework‚Äôs potential to redefine solo mining practices within the TON ecosystem. By adhering to the outlined prerequisites and testing procedures, miners can leverage this framework to maximize their mining efficiency and profitability in the evolving landscape of blockchain technology.

    keystore_dir = '/tmp/ton_keystore'
    Path(keystore_dir).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    client = TonlibClient(ls_index=0, config=ton_config, keystore=keystore_dir)
    await client.init()
    masterchain_info = await client.get_masterchain_info()
    await client.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### [](#conclusion-8)Conclusion

PyTONLib presents a robust and efficient pathway for Python developers to interact with the TON Blockchain. Its asynchronous client, coupled with the ability to directly connect to a LiteServer, provides a streamlined framework for developing blockchain applications. Through the examples provided, developers can quickly integrate blockchain functionalities into their Python applications, leveraging the full potential of TON Blockchain with minimal setup and overhead.

This project is SCAM. [üíé TONSquare Access Keys are LIVE NOW!](https://tonresear.ch/t/tonsquare-access-keys-are-live-now/18487)

They announced several partnerships, most of them are fake.  
CCA GROUP partner is not even on any social, totally unknown. I have been banned for asking infos about them.

Other 2 partners, their project is dead, asked them to prove partnership with TonSquare, they banned me from their Twitter (Avisa Games and CoinNerd).

TonSquare TG channel is the typical hype channel owned by bots and 2 silly moderators (Mohammed and Bruno), hyping each other while users asking for infos are muted or banned.

Beware, DO NOT BUY ACESS KEYS.

Look, when it comes to partnerships, it‚Äôs pretty normal for projects to get some heat, especially from folks who just don‚Äôt get it. CCA GROUP might not be blowing up on social media, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre a scam. A lot of legit projects keep a low profile and still do big things. Just because you can‚Äôt find every partner on social media doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre fake or whatever.

Getting banned for asking questions? That‚Äôs just how it is in any community, man. They gotta keep things running smoothly and focus on what matters. If people are just spreading negativity without any proof, it totally messes up the vibe tho

 

[Angus\_Murphy](https://tonresear.ch/u/Angus_Murphy) September 10, 2024, 7:41am  8

Haha, right? It‚Äôs wild how some KOLs will throw shade but still jump on the bandwagon with a YouTube video about TONSquare! Like, c‚Äômon, keep that negativity to yourself, man. Don‚Äôt let your personal opinions mess with the community vibe.

 

[Angus\_Murphy](https://tonresear.ch/u/Angus_Murphy) September 10, 2024, 7:44am  9

honestly, it‚Äôs just some dude‚Äôs opinion, man. people are gonna have their say, but let time do the talking. if you think it‚Äôs a scam, cool‚Äîlet‚Äôs see how it plays out. no need to get all worked up about it. just chill and let the project speek for itself! and for real, go take a hike with that negativity!

 

[Shasa](https://tonresear.ch/u/Shasa) September 10, 2024, 7:47am  10

A video of a smug, speculative and imposing person. Haven‚Äôt found anything convincing about these projects being scams, and this idiot is trying to poison crypto participants with this trash video!

honestly, it‚Äôs pretty annoying to see all this negativity. if you‚Äôve got concerns, fine, but at least make sure you‚Äôre not just spreading rumors! do your research before jumping to conclusions.

Shut up and be aware that‚Äôs a scam. You know that and you keep on frauding. Check TOS Telegram and X posts, every comment mentions scam. Now investors are aware. Tell your friends that some investor is not stupid as you, legal actions will be taken. No mainnet, no value, devs have Millions in TON. If you‚Äôre interested in knowing more and the truth, ask me and I‚Äôll provide you all wallets involved. If you just want to keep on shilling shit, just stfu.

# [Estimating Transaction Fees for Simple and Complex Blockchain Transactions](/t/estimating-transaction-fees-for-simple-and-complex-blockchain-transactions/31)

[Application](/c/application/20) 

    

[AnDYOR](https://tonresear.ch/u/AnDYOR)  December 8, 2023, 6:47am  1

As DApp developer, how to effectively estimate approximate transaction fee for simple and complex transactions?

Instead of a constant like 0.1 TON.

  1 Like

[doge](https://tonresear.ch/u/doge) January 18, 2024, 6:59am  2

As a DApp developer working with blockchain transactions, it‚Äôs essential to effectively estimate transaction fees for both simple and complex transactions. Here‚Äôs a professional and concise summary with highlighted key points, based on the provided article, focusing on TON blockchain but also touching upon Ethereum:

### [](#ethereum-vs-ton-gas-management-1)Ethereum vs TON Gas Management

*   **Ethereum**:
    
    *   **Low Gas**: Transaction reverts if gas is too low, gas not refunded.
    *   **Sufficient Gas**: Actual costs auto-calculated and deducted.
*   **TON**:
    
    *   **Insufficient Gas**: Partial transaction execution.
    *   **Excess Gas**: Developer‚Äôs responsibility to return.
    *   **Asynchronous Nature**: TON can‚Äôt auto-calculate due to potential delay in transaction completion and fluctuating user balances.

### [](#estimating-gas-in-ton-2)Estimating Gas in TON

1.  **Identify Entry Points**: Examine message flow for entry points.
2.  **Handler Cost Estimation**: Estimate the cost for each handler.
3.  **Check `msg_value`**: Ensure sufficient `msg_value` at entry points.
4.  **Avoid Excessive Demands**: Don‚Äôt uniformly demand high gas (e.g., 1 TON); allocate gas proportionally to the intended actions.

### [](#complexities-in-gas-estimation-3)Complexities in Gas Estimation

*   **Development Changes**: Update gas requirements if your contract‚Äôs message-sending behavior changes.

### [](#returning-gas-excesses-4)Returning Gas Excesses

*   **Accumulation of Funds**: Unreturned excess gas accumulates in contracts.
*   **Standard Practice**: Implement a function to return excesses (e.g., `op::excesses` in TON Jetton).

### [](#mechanism-in-ton-5)Mechanism in TON

*   **Forward Remaining Gas**: `SEND_MODE_CARRY_ALL_REMAINING_MESSAGE_VALUE` for linear message flows.
*   **Exceptions**: Avoid this mode when:
    *   Contract actions reduce balance, not `msg_value`.
    *   `storage_fee` depletes contract balance.
    *   Emitting events or attaching value to messages reduces contract balance.

### [](#calculating-gas-cost-in-ton-6)Calculating Gas Cost in TON

*   **Example from TON Wallet**:
    *   Consider `storage_fee` and `const::gas_consumption`.
    *   Adjust `msg_value` for these fees and forward ton amounts.
    *   Return remaining `msg_value` to prevent partial execution.

### [](#resume-7)Resume

*   **Developer Responsibility**: Active management of gas, considering the entire transaction process.
*   **Potential Increase in Costs**: Monitor for ‚Äúunbounded data structure‚Äù use.
*   **Return Excesses**: Essential for efficient gas management.
*   **Risk of Partial Execution**: A critical concern if gas runs out.

### [](#blockchain-transaction-fees-8)Blockchain Transaction Fees

*   **Economic Model**: Validators are compensated in blockchain‚Äôs token (e.g., TON coin in TON blockchain).
*   **Gas Analogy**: Necessary for transaction execution, similar to fuel for cars.
*   **User Transactions**: Require gas payment, authorized via wallet signatures.

Aspect

Ethereum

TON (The Open Network)

**Gas Management on Low Gas**

Transaction is reverted, gas is not refunded.

Transaction is partially executed.

**Gas Management on Sufficient Gas**

Actual costs are auto-calculated and deducted.

Excess gas must be returned; responsibility lies with the developer.

**Automatic Gas Calculation**

Automatic due to synchronous nature.

Not automatic due to asynchronous nature and fluctuating user balances.

**Estimating Gas Costs**

Not a major concern for contract developers; users bear the responsibility.

Developers need to estimate the cost of each handler and check sufficiency of `msg_value` at entry points.

**Gas Excess Management**

Not applicable as excess gas is automatically handled.

Excess gas accumulates in contracts if not returned; practice of returning excesses is recommended.

**Special Mechanisms**

Not applicable for handling gas excess.

`SEND_MODE_CARRY_ALL_REMAINING_MESSAGE_VALUE` used for linear message flows but with exceptions.

**Gas Deduction**

From gas provided by the user.

From the contract balance in certain actions (e.g., emitting events, attaching value to messages).

**Handling Complex Transactions**

Simplified due to synchronous execution and automatic gas calculation.

Requires careful planning and adjustment based on contract behavior changes.

**Risk of Partial Execution**

Not applicable, as transactions either complete entirely or revert.

A critical concern; can occur if gas runs out.

In summary, estimating transaction fees in TON requires a careful assessment of the message flow, handler costs, and proactive management of gas, considering the asynchronous and distributed nature of the blockchain. Ensuring efficient gas use and returning excesses are crucial practices for optimal contract operation.

# [Advanced Guide to Jetton Implementation on TON Blockchain](/t/advanced-guide-to-jetton-implementation-on-ton-blockchain/314)

[Application](/c/application/20) 

    

[Simpson](https://tonresear.ch/u/Simpson)   February 7, 2024, 4:22am  1

In this comprehensive technical article, we delve into the intricacies of implementing Jetton tokens on the TON Blockchain, offering developers a robust template and essential guidelines for effective development and deployment. This guide is meticulously designed to assist developers in navigating through the Jetton implementation process, providing a seamless start point for integrating this innovative token system within their applications.

### [](#overview-1)![:blue_book:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/blue_book.png?v=12 ":blue_book:") Overview

Jetton tokens represent a versatile mechanism for asset management on the TON Blockchain, offering enhanced functionality and flexibility for developers and users alike. This guide introduces a detailed template for Jetton implementation, accompanied by clear instructions and best practices to ensure a smooth development journey.

### [](#getting-started-2)![:rocket:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/rocket.png?v=12 ":rocket:") Getting Started

To kickstart your Jetton implementation, the following commands are crucial:

```
yarn build # Compiles the contract
yarn test # Executes test cases
yarn deploy # Deploys the contract to the blockchain
---
yarn read # Reads contract data
yarn d1 # (Optional) Transfers Jetton Token to a new account
yarn d2 # (Optional) Generates a Transfer URL for Jetton Token redistribution
```

Additional details are accessible in the `package.json` file, offering developers a comprehensive toolkit for effective Jetton management.

### [](#key-implementation-insights-3)![:hammer_and_wrench:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/hammer_and_wrench.png?v=12 ":hammer_and_wrench:") Key Implementation Insights

*   **Data Storage**: Jetton content is efficiently stored using the `Cell` data structure, optimizing space and access.
*   **Naming Conventions**: Following [TEP-74](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0074-jettons-standard.md), it‚Äôs critical to use lowercase for names in `get_jetton_data()` to ensure compatibility with major explorers.
*   **Supply Management**: The `max_supply` parameter offers flexibility in controlling token issuance, though the Jetton Root Contract‚Äôs `Total Supply` remains the primary metric.
*   **Token Transfer**: Uniquely, transferring Jetton Tokens requires sending a message to the sender‚Äôs Jetton Wallet, not directly to the recipient‚Äôs.
*   **Minimum TON Amount**: Setting the `forward_ton_amount` to as low as 1e-9 TON is possible, aligning with practices from [TelemintNFT](https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/telemint).

### [](#references-4)![:books:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/books.png?v=12 ":books:") References

To deepen your understanding and explore further into Jetton implementation, the following resources are invaluable:

*   **TON Dev Chat \[EN\]**: [Telegram Channel](https://t.me/tondev_eng)
*   **TON Dev ‰∏≠Êñá**: [Telegram Channel](https://t.me/tondev_zh)

### [](#deployment-guidelines-6)![:ship:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/ship.png?v=12 ":ship:") Deployment Guidelines

For successful contract deployment, adhere to the following steps:

1.  Ensure `contract.tact` is set as the entry point.
2.  Tailor `contract.deploy.ts` to match your `contract.tact` structure, particularly the Init() function call.

Modifications to `contract.tact` necessitate updates in `tact.config.json`, as detailed in the [Tact Documentation](https://docs.tact-lang.org/language/guides/config).

### [](#testing-framework-7)![:white_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:") Testing Framework

Incorporate contract tests via `contract.spec.ts`, with extensive guidelines available in the [Tact Documentation](https://docs.tact-lang.org/language/guides/debug). New test files should mimic the provided template for automatic inclusion.

### [](#license-8)![:page_facing_up:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/page_facing_up.png?v=12 ":page_facing_up:") License

This Jetton implementation template is freely available under the MIT license, promoting open and accessible development within the TON ecosystem.

# [Implementing TON Restaking: The UTONIC Approach](/t/implementing-ton-restaking-the-utonic-approach/31441)

[Application](/c/application/20) 

    

[UTONIC](https://tonresear.ch/u/UTONIC)   September 6, 2024, 3:36pm  1

We plan to implement the UTONIC protocol, which will be the first restaking protocol on the TON network. Similar to how EigenLayer introduced restaking to the Ethereum ecosystem‚Äîcurrently securing 5% of the total ETH supply to protect various applications on Ethereum‚ÄîUTONIC will bring restaking to the TON ecosystem. This will enhance the security of the growing number of applications on TON, increase the value and yield of TON assets, and encourage more TON holders to participate in staking.

TLDR

*   UTONIC is the first restaking solution on the TON network, modeled after Ethereum‚Äôs EigenLayer.
*   Restaking enhances security and scalability by allowing staked assets to secure multiple decentralized applications. It also increases use cases and yields for TON, concentrating value towards the TON token.
*   UTONIC supports both native TON tokens and Liquid Staking Tokens to participate in restaking. The native restaking is based on the Nominator Pool staking.
*   The UTONIC architecture consists of several key components: Stakers, Vaults, Restaking Module, Operators, Actively Validated Services (AVS).

# [](#p-48378-background-1)Background

Restaking allows staked assets to be used for securing multiple networks or protocols simultaneously. Restaking enables the same tokens to be utilized across multiple layers, increasing the utility and potential returns for token holders. This method also enhances security and decentralization by allowing stakers to support various applications without needing to acquire additional assets.

Restaking was first introduced into the Ethereum ecosystem by EigenLayer, a pioneering restaking project on the Ethereum network. It leverages staked ETH to secure and protect additional dApps and protocols built on Ethereum. As of now, EigenLayer has managed to lock up 5% of the total ETH supply (4.7 million ETH, $12B TVL), supporting more than 16 Actively Validated Services (AVS).

Following the emergence of EigenLayer, restaking has become one of the hottest topics in the industry. Beyond Ethereum, other networks like Solana and BNB Chain have begun developing their own restaking protocols. For instance, Solayer handles restaking on Solana, while BinLayer does so on BNB Chain. Currently, however, there is no restaking protocol available on the TON network.

The Open Network (TON) is a decentralized and open internet platform focusing on achieving mass adoption while operating in a highly scalable secure framework. TON has now become one of the top ten public blockchains by market capital.

TON restaking is crucial as it enhances the security and scalability of the TON ecosystem by allowing existing staked assets and methods to be used in securing additional decentralized applications and services, where many of them will choose hybrid on-chain and off-chain structure to serve reaching hundreds of millions of users moving forward. This approach leverages the network‚Äôs existing validators, creating a more robust, flexible and economically-efficient infrastructure without the need for new resources.

Restaking Benefits:

1.  For TON Ecosystem: The network structure of TON Layer 1 is well-suited for certain applications, but there are also scenarios where it may not be the best fit, like where it needs atomic transactions and synchronicity. In these cases, Layer 2 solutions and Bridges are often required to meet the development and usage needs of such applications. TON Restaking can enhance the security of these Layer 2 solutions and Bridges, thus fostering the growth of the TON ecosystem.
2.  For TON Applications: New applications can build on a robust security foundation provided by TON restaking, thus encouraging innovation and leading to broader adoption within the ecosystem.
3.  For TON Holders: TON will have more use cases, resulting in greater yields for staking. Applications will rely on TON for security rather than issuing new assets, leading to a concentration of value towards the TON token.

# [](#p-48378-native-restaking-based-on-nominator-pool-3)Native Restaking: Based on Nominator Pool

There are currently several ways to participate in TON staking, which can generally be categorized into two types:

1.  Using a Hot Wallet for Staking: This method is less secure because the wallet holding the funds needs to be kept on the validator node, making it vulnerable to hacking.
2.  Using a Nominator Pool for Staking: This approach allows users to separate the wallet holding the funds from the validator wallet, enabling secure participation in staking.

The Nominator Pool is an excellent smart contract design that greatly enhances the security of TON staking. More importantly, it is a smart contract that can be further improved, giving us the flexibility to build on it and implement the restaking functionality.

UTONIC smart contracts will delegate the staked TON to the established Nominator Pool for participation in TON staking, while also opting into the restaking modules built on UTONIC. A key function of the UTONIC smart contracts is to act as the deployer, fund provider, and fund withdrawer for the Nominator Pool. If a staker who has restaked on UTONIC is proven to have behaved adversarially while participating in an AVS, then that staker‚Äôs TON will be withdrawn from the Nominator Pool and be slashed according to the on-chain slashing contract of the AVS.

# [](#p-48378-lst-restaking-4)LST Restaking

In addition to supporting native TON tokens for restaking through an upgraded Nominator Pool, we also support LST (Liquid Staking Token) participation in restaking. Our decision to support LST restaking is based on the following considerations:

1.  Established LST protocols have already implemented the core functionalities for participating in Layer 1 staking and distributing staking rewards, ensuring that the LST tokens are backed by a corresponding amount of staked TON assets.
2.  Using LST tokens for restaking has proven to be a viable solution in Ethereum‚Äôs restaking ecosystem, with successful implementations seen in projects like EigenLayer and Symbiotic.
3.  Supporting LST participation in restaking prevents the need for TON tokens to be withdrawn from LSTs solely for restaking purposes, thereby improving the whole capital efficiency within the TON ecosystem and offering convenience to TON users.

# [](#p-48378-lrt-liquidity-creates-value-5)LRT: Liquidity Creates Value

Beyond implementing the basic restaking framework, we also support minting Liquid Restaking Tokens. This approach helps to prevent liquidity shortages within the ecosystem that can arise when assets are locked up in staking and restaking.

**Stakers**

Stakers contribute to universal security from TON in exchange for rewards.

**Vaults**

Vaults act as the restaking management layer for TON restaking.

**Restaking Module**

The Restaking Module is a suite of smart contracts that handle the core logic for delegation, operator registration, AVS registration, reward distribution, and slashing.

**Operators**

Operators, whether an individual or an institution, perform essential validation and security for distributed secure services.

**Actively Validated Services (AVS)**

Actively Validated Services utilize the restaked TON to enhance security while reducing operational expenses.

I‚Äôve been playing Bee Harvest for over two months now, and in that time I‚Äôve never had the thought of it being another boring game in catalog.  
Players join clans and help each other, and the developers in turn work hard every for product improvement. The team is very brave indeed, as they are creating a product unlike any other. I am sure they will be able to reach many millions of bees in their family.

Great project! The only one of its kind. It is clear that the developers are trying to make the game even better and more interesting, unlike many other projects where you need to sit and poke your finger at the screen from morning to evening, it is not clear why.

*   Project‚Äôs Name: Cowtopia  
    Cowtopia is an innovative farming game on the TON blockchain, blending traditional farming simulation with NFT collectibles and competitive gameplay. Players manage farms, collect milk, and complete tasks while building a collection of legendary COW NFTs. These NFTs are crucial for participating in competitions to win LAND NFTs, which enable crystal mining. Crystals can be exchanged for $COWT, the game‚Äôs native token. The game offers a unique experience combining resource management, strategy, and competition. Players can invite friends, upgrade farms, and strive to become top farmers in this digital agricultural world. Cowtopia appeals to both casual gamers and competitive players, offering a rich, engaging experience in the blockchain gaming space.

**Mine2Mine ‚Äî mining launchpad on TON.**  
Other coins for mining will be available soon!

**Mine2Mine is the first app that allows you to mine real GPU coins using virtual GPU graphics cards and taps.**

No more dealing with the complicated setup of mining ‚Äî the Mine2Mine team has done it all for you. All you need to do is buy a virtual graphics card or simply start tapping to earn real GPU tokens, which can be immediately sold on decentralized exchanges.

The distribution of GPU started recently from mining pools, similar to how TON was distributed. In the future, the Mine2Mine app will allow mining of other tokens as well.

If you missed the opportunity to turn on your graphics card to mine TON, now is the perfect time to activate GPU while the project is in its early stages!

Below the message,

Fellow Dogz holders,

Today, I stand before you with a clear message: Dogz is more than just a project. It‚Äôs a long-term vision, a path we are walking together, built on pure tech, innovation, and the relentless development of utilities and decentralized applications (dApps). We are building something strong, something lasting.

Our vision goes beyond quick gains or fleeting hype. This isn‚Äôt a project for the faint of heart or those seeking the next degen play. Dogz is for those who understand the value of patience, commitment, and true innovation. We are building our own chain, crafted with the purpose of delivering real value, driven by advanced technology and a community that stands at the core of it all.

Dogz holders, you are more than just investors. You are the core. You are validators. You are the foundation upon which this ecosystem will thrive. We are dedicated to ensuring that every step forward is made with you in mind, bringing real, lasting benefits that resonate with our long-term goals.

We already have everything we need to build upon. The foundation is strong, and the vision is clear. But remember, this journey isn‚Äôt about hype or short-term rewards. It‚Äôs about something much greater. It‚Äôs about creating a legacy. This is my path. This is my life. This is my journey.

To those who walk this road with us, know that we are building something that will stand the test of time. Together, we will achieve greatness, brick by brick, with patience, resilience, and dedication.

Thank you for believing in Dogz. This is just the beginning.

Ca:

## [](#p-49526-projects-name-1)Project‚Äôs Name

NOTBITCOIN  
It‚Äôs not Bitcoin, NOTBITCOIN is the free payment method within Telegram Mini Apps  

[![image](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/649e492a67776ee1bb6dd1ce57008aabd334cb48_2_690x341.jpeg)

## [](#p-49526-projects-message-2)Project‚Äôs Message

Currently, Bitcoin is no longer truly decentralized. It is largely held by investment funds, large  
economic organizations, and wealthy individuals. They use Bitcoin as a trump card to  
manipulate the entire cryptocurrency market and always find ways to take money from  
inexperienced and small investors; even those with many years of experience cannot  
escape this manipulation.

Bitcoin is no longer suitable as a means of payment for everyone because it is expensive, manipulated, slow.  
Why should the entire crypto market be dependent on and controlled by Bitcoin?

We, users, supporters, investors, crypto and blockchain developers, are tired of this and  
wish for a new cryptocurrency platform to replace Bitcoin.  
NOTBITCOIN is distributed for free to everyone, offering a new opportunity, a fresh breeze we  
want to bring to everyone, especially small investors who do not have money.

## [](#p-49526-projects-plan-detail-3)Project‚Äôs Plan & Detail

Phase 1: Free mining for everyone

Thank you for the opportunity to apply for the league. Unfortunately, our app is likely to be completed around September 12th, so we are unable to provide the necessary metrics at this time. We‚Äôll aim for the next season!

However, we have attached a half photo that shows how the app will work. This app is being created for the TON community and will include the following tasks in the Rebalancer APP:

1.  **Referral System Expansion**: Invite friends through your referral link and earn bonuses.
2.  **Channel Subscriptions**: Subscribe to recommended channels and receive rewards.
3.  **Token Purchase and Hold**: Buy tokens and hold them to earn additional bonuses.
4.  **Token Staking**: Participate in staking to grow your assets.
5.  **Token Farming**: Join farming to receive a steady income.  
    6- **Daily Claiming**: Log in to the app daily to claim free tokens from our partners. A simple action ‚Äî daily profits!

    Crazy Rush Heroes,CRH, was launched on 24th July under TOWER Ecosystem; CRH is the flagship Telegram Mini App in the ecosystem which leveraged the IP of Crazy Defense Heroes which is the first P&E mobile tower defense game launched under TOWER Ecosystem back in 2021.
    

CRH aims to provide an action-tight and short-session gaming experience in Telegram so everyone can enjoy the dopamine rush in minutes. We got a 21K MAU organically on 18 August; a new ATH will come as we are continuously launching new features with quick agile roll-up. With the traction of the TON Open League Season 6, the growth will be tremendous. For more details visuals and metrics, please refer to the below Google Doc.
