We are a DAO community. Main advantage is that we created a supportive environment for the innovation and kickstarting Web3 projects which manifests in a recent launch of Shardify protocol. The essence of the protocol is that every user can shard an NFT into smaller tokens or purchase parts of the NFT.

Currently, our protocol has added the Notcoin Pre-Market collection and a total of 24 thousand vouchers have been split into wTON.

### [](#curdle-protocol-where-excellence-meets-innovation-1)Curdle Protocol: Where Excellence Meets Innovation

**Low Slippage**  
![:point_right:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/point_right.png?v=12 ":point_right:") Experience trading like never before with Curdle’s minimal slippage, ensuring the ultimate trading experience.

**Capital Efficiency**  
![:point_right:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/point_right.png?v=12 ":point_right:") Curdle pools various tokens with highly concentrated liquidity, maximizing your trading efficiency.

**Low IL (Impermanent Loss)**  
![:point_right:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/point_right.png?v=12 ":point_right:") Curdle minimizes impermanent loss for liquidity providers, making it a safer and more profitable choice.

Our protocol’s standout feature is the ability to pool multiple tokens with customizable weights, setting us apart from competitors like Ston Fi and Dedust. Traders benefit from incredibly low fees and ultra-low slippage, enhancing their trading experience significantly.

We are excited to gradually release our whitepaper, algorithms, architecture, **solidify** mechanism, FunC best practices, and open-source contracts. Stay tuned for our upcoming referral program and exciting events.

# [Simplifying TON Network Site Deployment with TON Proxy Docker](/t/simplifying-ton-network-site-deployment-with-ton-proxy-docker/194)

[TON Blockchain](/c/ton-blockchain/ton-proxy/14)  [TON Proxy](/c/ton-blockchain/ton-proxy/14) 

    

[satoshi](https://tonresear.ch/u/satoshi)   February 4, 2024, 12:06pm  1

### [](#introduction-1)Introduction

Deploying sites on the TON (Telegram Open Network) blockchain is made significantly easier with the TON Proxy Docker. This tool streamlines the process of running the [rldp-http-proxy](https://ton.org/docs/#/web3/sites-and-proxy?id=running-ton-site) in a Docker container, enabling users to deploy their sites on the TON network efficiently. This document outlines the hardware requirements, setup instructions, and configuration options for using TON Proxy Docker.

### [](#hardware-requirements-2)Hardware Requirements

The table below outlines the minimum hardware requirements for building TON binaries and running the TON Proxy Docker:

Requirement

Specification

RAM

At least 2 GB

### [](#running-the-proxy-3)Running the Proxy

Deploying your site on the TON network involves several straightforward steps:

1.  **Configuration in Docker-Compose**: Set the TON repository branch in the `docker-compose.yml` file under the `rldp-proxy.build.args` section.
2.  **Building the Image**: Build the Docker image with the command `docker-compose build`.
3.  **Initializing Proxy Configuration**:
    *   Run `./init.sh` to generate a new ADNL ID, download the mainnet configuration, and create a `.env` file with settings.
    *   If an ADNL ID already exists, place it in `private/adnl` and `private/adnl-hex`, and copy the contents of your `keyring` file into `adnl-private`.
4.  **Launching the Proxy**: Start the proxy using `docker-compose up -d`. This assumes the site is already operational on port 80 on the same machine.
5.  **ADNL Address**: The `private/adnl` file contains the user-friendly ADNL form. Use this address to access your site.

### [](#proxy-settings-4)Proxy Settings

Configuration settings for the TON Proxy are managed in the `.env` file located at the repository’s root. The table below details these settings and their purposes:

Setting

Description

`TON_PROXY_PORT=8080`

Specifies the HTTP listening port.

`TON_PROXY_SERVER_IP`

Your server’s public IP. Use `curl https://ipinfo.io/ip` to retrieve your IP.

`TON_PROXY_ADNL_PORT=3333`

Defines the port for ADNL queries.

`TON_PROXY_REMOTE_ADDR`

The address where HTTP requests are proxied. Change to direct requests to a different machine.

`TON_PROXY_VERBOSITY=3`

Sets the verbosity level. A value of `0` is recommended for production environments.

`TON_PROXY_PROXY_ALL=NO`

Determines whether to proxy all HTTP requests. By default, only \*.ton and \*.adnl requests are proxied.

### [](#conclusion-5)Conclusion

The TON Proxy Docker offers a simplified solution for deploying sites on the TON blockchain, eliminating the complexity associated with manual proxy configuration and deployment. By following the provided setup instructions and adjusting the proxy settings as needed, users can efficiently establish their presence on the TON network, leveraging its decentralized architecture for enhanced security and accessibility.

# [Deploying TON Storage and Proxy Services Using Docker: A Comprehensive Guide](/t/deploying-ton-storage-and-proxy-services-using-docker-a-comprehensive-guide/195)

[TON Blockchain](/c/ton-blockchain/ton-storage/31)  [TON Storage](/c/ton-blockchain/ton-storage/31) 

    

[satoshi](https://tonresear.ch/u/satoshi)  February 4, 2024, 12:09pm  1

### [](#introduction-1)Introduction

The TON Storage Docker facilitates the deployment of decentralized storage solutions on the TON (Telegram Open Network) blockchain, encompassing both a storage daemon and a storage gateway within a singular Docker container. For enhanced functionality, users can optionally deploy a TON proxy container. This document provides a detailed walkthrough for setting up these services, configuring storage parameters, and uploading content to TON storage.

### [](#setup-and-configuration-2)Setup and Configuration

The process to get started with TON Storage Docker involves initial configuration, adjustment of environment settings, building Docker images, and running the services. The table below outlines the critical steps and corresponding commands:

Step

Command

Description

Initial Configuration

`./init.sh mainnet` or `./init.sh testnet`

Initializes the environment for either the mainnet or testnet. Optionally, enable TON proxy with `TON_PROXY_ENABLED=1`.

ADNL Address Setup

N/A

For existing ADNL addresses, place relevant files in `private/`.

Environment Settings

Check and edit `.env`

Customize settings such as ports, IP addresses, and verbosity levels in the `.env` file.

Docker Image Building

`docker-compose build`

Builds Docker images for the TON storage daemon, gateway, and optionally, the TON proxy.

Running Services

`docker-compose up -d`

Launches the Docker containers for TON storage and proxy services.

### [](#uploading-content-to-ton-storage-3)Uploading Content to TON Storage

To upload content to TON Storage, users should place files in the `exchange` folder, access the Docker container’s shell, and utilize the `storage-daemon-cli` tool following the provided instructions. This process enables the creation of a “bag of files” for storage on the TON blockchain.

### [](#configuration-settings-4)Configuration Settings

Settings for the TON Storage Docker are primarily managed within the `.env` file. Detailed below are the key configuration options for the storage daemon, storage gateway, and TON proxy:

#### [](#storage-daemon-settings-5)Storage Daemon Settings

Setting

Description

`TON_STORAGE_ADNL_PORT`

Specifies the port for ADNL queries.

`TON_STORAGE_CONTROL_PORT`

Defines the control port for daemon management.

`TON_STORAGE_VERBOSITY_LEVEL`

Sets the verbosity level for logging.

`TON_STORAGE_PUBLIC_IP`

Indicates the public IP address of the storage service.

#### [](#storage-gateway-settings-wip-6)Storage Gateway Settings (WIP)

Setting

Description

`TON_STORAGE_GATEWAY_PORT`

Port for storage gateway operations.

`TON_STORAGE_GATEWAY_DOMAIN`

Domain name for the storage gateway (work in progress).

#### [](#proxy-settings-7)Proxy Settings

Setting

Description

`TON_PROXY_ENABLED`

Enables or disables the TON proxy service.

`TON_PROXY_PORT`

HTTP listening port for the proxy.

`TON_PROXY_ADNL_PORT`

Port for ADNL queries through the proxy.

`TON_PROXY_VERBOSITY_LEVEL`

Sets the verbosity level for proxy operations.

### [](#faq-8)FAQ

**Q: How do I verify if the TON proxy is operational?**

A: You can verify the proxy’s functionality using `curl` commands to send requests through your proxy or public TON proxies. Successful HTML code retrieval indicates an operational proxy.

### [](#conclusion-9)Conclusion

Deploying TON Storage and Proxy services using Docker streamlines the process of participating in the TON blockchain’s decentralized storage ecosystem. By following the setup instructions, adjusting configuration settings, and utilizing the provided tools for content upload, users can efficiently manage and access decentralized storage solutions on the TON network.

**О проекте:**  
**Blum** – это новое решение для торговли криптовалютами, созданная группой бывших сотрудников Binance  
Она нацелена на расширение возможностей децентрализованных бирж (DEX). Весной 2024 года проект отмечен **Binance Labs** в числе 13 избранных из 700 на 7-м сезоне акселератора Most Valuable Builder.  
Можно начать только по приглашениям

Каждому участнику дают 10 пригласительных, т.е. один человек не может пригласить более 10 друзей, поэтому не упустите возможность воспользоваться ссылками для приглашения, пока они не заняты другими

**Основная задача**: Клеймить награду каждые 8 часов

Недавно вышло обновление, была добавлена мини-игра

В 1 игре можно заработать в среднем 170 blum

Перед запуском платформы планируется крупный аирдроп токена Blum Point. По дорожной карте запуск планируется до конца июня

Baby Notcoin: The Adorable baby version of Notcoin on the TON Chain ![:gem:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/gem.png?v=12 ":gem:")

The cuter, smaller offspring of the original Notcoin on the TON Chain. While we might be tiny, we’re bursting with potential and ready to take the crypto world by storm—baby steps first, of course!

We’re not just another coin; we’re a movement. A tiny, giggling, diaper-clad movement. Our upcoming tapping game is the perfect blend of fun and finance. Tap, play, and earn your way to the top! Just like any baby, we thrive on attention. Join our growing family and help Baby Notcoin grow!

We might be small, but we have big dreams. Probably nothing, but definitely something. Get ready to fall in love with Baby Notcoin the cutest new addition to your crypto family!

Token Distribution Overview

The total supply of our tokens is 10 million, with the marketing wallet holding the largest share at 2.5%, following several buybacks. The distribution among holders is well-balanced, with no single wallet dominating.

Our token has been verified on [Dedust.io](http://Dedust.io) and is listed as one of the default tokens. It is also verified by the Tonkeeper wallet.

Roadmap ahead:

We are excited to announce that our P2E Baby Coin tapping game has entered the beta testing phase and will be launched in the coming weeks. Initially, community members can earn $NOT and $BBNOT through the game. In subsequent stages, following various partnerships, the game will serve as a dynamic platform for new token distribution.

To increase your token’s visibility, consider adding it as a prize in the Baby Notcoin game to attract more holders.

# [Efficient Data Indexing for TON Blockchain with C++ Worker](/t/efficient-data-indexing-for-ton-blockchain-with-c-worker/196)

[Application](/c/application/20) 

[indexer](https://tonresear.ch/tag/indexer), [api](https://tonresear.ch/tag/api)

    

[satoshi](https://tonresear.ch/u/satoshi)   February 4, 2024, 12:13pm  1

### [](#introduction-1)Introduction

The C++ worker for the TON indexer represents a critical component in the architecture of the TON (The Open Network) blockchain data management system. Designed to read data directly from TON node files, parse TL-B schemas, and efficiently insert the data into a PostgreSQL database, this worker enhances the performance and reliability of data indexing on the TON blockchain. This document provides a comprehensive guide on installing and configuring the C++ worker for optimal operation.

### [](#installation-overview-2)Installation Overview

The C++ worker can be set up in two distinct ways: as a systemd daemon for continuous operation or manually for more controlled deployment. Regardless of the method chosen, it is imperative to ensure that the TON Index database is properly configured prior to initiating the worker setup.

### [](#installation-methods-3)Installation Methods

#### [](#h-1-setup-as-systemd-daemon-4)1\. Setup as Systemd Daemon

This method facilitates the worker’s operation as a background service, ensuring it runs continuously and restarts automatically upon failure or system reboot.

*   **Command**: `./scripts/add2systemd.sh <args> [--force]`
*   **Note**: Utilize `--force` to rebuild the binary, if necessary.

#### [](#h-2-manual-installation-5)2\. Manual Installation

Manual installation offers more granular control over the build and execution process, ideal for development or testing environments.

1.  **Install Required Packages**: Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2.  **Build TON Index Worker Binary**: Compile the worker using CMake and Ninja.
3.  **Install Binary**: Move the compiled binary to a system-accessible location.
4.  **Adjust System Limits**: Increase the limit for maximum opened files.
5.  **Run TON Index Worker**: Execute the worker with the necessary arguments.

### [](#configuration-and-arguments-6)Configuration and Arguments

To achieve optimal performance, the worker can be configured with several arguments that dictate its operation, including database connection details, indexing start point, and parallelization settings.

Argument

Description

`--db <path>`

Path to the TON node directory.

`--host <ip>`

PostgreSQL server IP address.

`--port <port>`

PostgreSQL server port.

`--user <user>`

PostgreSQL username.

`--password <password>`

PostgreSQL password.

`--dbname <dbname>`

PostgreSQL database name.

`--from <seqno>`

Masterchain sequence number to start indexing from.

`--max-parallel-tasks`

Maximum number of parallel disk reading tasks.

`--insert-batch-size`

Maximum number of masterchain sequences in one INSERT query.

`--insert-parallel-actors`

Maximum number of concurrent INSERT queries.

### [](#conclusion-7)Conclusion

The C++ worker for the TON indexer significantly enhances the efficiency and scalability of blockchain data indexing on the TON network. By following the detailed installation and configuration guidelines provided, users can ensure a seamless setup process and optimal operation of the worker, contributing to the robustness and reliability of the TON blockchain infrastructure.

Недавно проекту исполнился месяц с момента листинга, ([Telegram: Contact @zicelaqo](https://t.me/zicelaqo/1687)) тогда я зафиксировал 305 TON прибыли ([Telegram: Contact @zicelaqo](https://t.me/zicelaqo/1695)). Давайте сделаем краткий рекап того, что с проектом произошло за это время. Если не вдаваться в подробности, то цена не уходила ниже пресейла, что на фоне остальных выглядит не плохо. Но всё же в подробности углубиться стоит.

Я уже говорил, что мемтокены, если укатываются, то больше не взлетают. ([Telegram: Contact @zicelaqo](https://t.me/zicelaqo/1705))  
Но здесь мы имеем другой паттерн — токен утилитарный и сила рук холдеров удивляет. Кстати, напомню, что у BURN нету маркет-мейкера. Я заметил одну странность, что любой токен который говорит что у его есть хороший ММ - по итогу сливается, причем это уже как гарантированное событие, но это не удивительно, внутри ТОН сейчас крайне много дерьма. Количество холдеров постепенно увеличивается, а само комьюнити самоорганизовалось и создала собственное DAO, внутри которого принимаются решения по продвижению проекта и даже билдится несколько ботов.

![:chart_with_upwards_trend:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/chart_with_upwards_trend.png?v=12 ":chart_with_upwards_trend:") Если же говорить про заслуги команды:

— Создали первый токен на TON с дефляционной механикой. За первый месяц сожжено более 13% саплая.

— Произошел релиз собственного приложения Burn UI ([https://app.burncoin.org/](https://app.burncoin.org/)), где вы можете сжигать монеты напрямую и зарабатывать Burn Points. Так же был анонсирован лидерборд.

— Помимо утилити Burn Points точно известно, что они взаимосвязаны с неким NFT Proof of Burn.

— Из 62 токенов Open League, только 17 токенов, включая Burncoin имеют синий значок проверки владельца токена, плюс не относится к разряду MEM-токена.

— 640.000$ анлоков снова были заблокированы.

![:heart_eyes:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/heart_eyes.png?v=12 ":heart_eyes:") Но самая главная новость — команда презентовала будущий Prediction Market под названием Prophet.  
И не просто онлайн, а прямиком на московском буткемпе, где получила приз зрительских симпатий!

И именно с этим продуктом проект BURN подался на грядущий хакатон с призовым фондом в более, чем 2kk.  
Их разработчик (c ним я общался в сообществе DAO) уже занимал призовые места на подобных ивентах, поэтому шансы победить довольно хорошие.

Так как я нахожусь в сообществе DAO BURN, то могу сказать так: очень много чего вам не рассказывают насчет идеи этого проекта и дальнейших планов, а они там действительно серьезные.

![:star2:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/star2.png?v=12 ":star2:") В целом данный проект я захваливать постоянно не намерен. Если будет какой-то косячок, то я конечно же об этом скажу и не буду просто молчать, но пока-что все реально прекрасно и я верю в этот проект, надеюсь, что они зашиллятся еще намного больше среди ТОН.

# [NFT Sniper Pro: Бот и мини-приложение в Telegram для трейдинга NFT и быстрых покупок](/t/nft-sniper-pro-telegram-nft/19707)

[Русский](/c/ru/49) 

    

[Mint0x](https://tonresear.ch/u/Mint0x)   June 1, 2024, 6:19am  1

**NFT Sniper Pro** – это автоматизированный сервис, предназначенный для помощи пользователям в поиске и быстрой покупке новых или редких NFT (невзаимозаменяемых токенов) на различных платформах и маркетплейсах в экосистеме TON. Этот бот и мини-приложение в Telegram предлагают множество функций, значительно упрощающих процесс торговли NFT. Ниже мы рассмотрим основные возможности NFT Sniper Pro и ответим на часто задаваемые вопросы о его использовании.

**Основные функции NFT Sniper Pro**

1.  Уведомления  
    Одной из ключевых функций NFT Sniper Pro является система уведомлений. Пользователи получают мгновенные оповещения о новых лотах, выставленных на продажу, которые соответствуют указанным критериям. Эти критерии могут включать цену, категорию, художника и другие фильтры. Это позволяет трейдерам оперативно реагировать на интересные предложения и не упускать выгодные сделки.
    
2.  Покупка в один клик  
    NFT Sniper Pro позволяет пользователям покупать NFT прямо из Telegram всего за несколько секунд. Для этого необходимо подключить свой кошелек к маркетплейсу. Функция покупки в один клик делает процесс крайне удобным и быстрым, что особенно важно на высококонкурентном рынке NFT, где скорость реакции критична.

# [Enhancing TON Blockchain Validation with Liquid Staking Protocol](/t/enhancing-ton-blockchain-validation-with-liquid-staking-protocol/199)

[TON Blockchain](/c/ton-blockchain/build-node/21)  [TON Node](/c/ton-blockchain/build-node/21)

[Simpson](https://tonresear.ch/u/Simpson)   February 4, 2024, 12:42pm  1

### [](#introduction-1)Introduction

The Liquid Staking (LSt) protocol serves as a groundbreaking innovation designed to bridge TON holders with node operators, facilitating seamless participation in TON Blockchain validation via asset pooling. This protocol not only democratizes the staking process but also integrates seamlessly with DeFi protocols, offering TON holders, referred to as _Nominators_, an opportunity to earn validation rewards through Pool Jettons. This document provides an in-depth overview of the LSt protocol, its technical components, and operational guidelines for both nominators and node operators.

](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/original/1X/b7f88ae895d7b11e411f2bd3f1a943d53a19bb6c.png "image")

### [](#protocol-overview-2)Protocol Overview

The LSt protocol introduces a dynamic ecosystem where nominators can lend their TON assets to a pool, receiving Pool Jettons in return. These Jettons, representing a share of the pool, appreciate in value by accruing validation rewards, thereby offering a compelling incentive for TON holders. Node operators, on the other hand, utilize these pooled funds as validation stakes, sharing the accrued rewards with the pool.

Component

Functionality

Nominators

TON holders who lend their assets to the pool in exchange for Pool Jettons.

Node Operators

Participants who utilize pooled funds for blockchain validation, sharing rewards with the pool.

Pool Jettons

Tokens representing a share in the pool, which can be utilized in various DeFi protocols.

Liquid Staking Pool

Central contract managing interactions between controllers, stakers, and the governance framework.

### [](#technical-workflow-3)Technical Workflow

1.  **Asset Pooling**: Nominators lend their TON assets to the pool, receiving Pool Jettons that represent their share and potential for reward accrual.
2.  **Validation Stake**: Node operators request funds from the pool, using them as stakes for blockchain validation.
3.  **Reward Distribution**: Post-validation, the node operators return the stake along with an agreed-upon interest back to the pool, which then distributes the rewards among Pool Jettons holders.

### [](#key-components-4)Key Components

*   **Controller**: A smart contract managing funds for validation stakes, ensuring assets lent to validators are safeguarded and appropriately utilized.
*   **Pool**: The central contract that interfaces with controllers, manages deposits and withdrawals, and oversees the overall lending and reward distribution process.
*   **Pool Jetton**: A scalable token on the TON blockchain representing a share in the pool, capable of accruing validation rewards and participating in DAO voting for network config parameters.

### [](#roles-and-responsibilities-5)Roles and Responsibilities

Role

Responsibilities

Halter

Responsible for halting the system in case of anomalies.

Sudoer

Can send arbitrary messages from any part of the system after a certain threshold, mainly for emergency actions or upgrades.

Approver

Approves Controllers for borrow requests, ensuring only credible node operators can request funds.

Interest Manager

Analyzes round stats and updates interest rates based on performance and market conditions.

Governor

Sets roles, parameters, and governs the overall protocol operations, ensuring smooth functioning.

### [](#getting-started-with-development-6)Getting Started with Development

Developers looking to contribute to the LSt protocol can follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository with all submodules.
2.  Install dependencies using Node v18 or above.
3.  Build contracts and run tests to ensure stability and integrity.
4.  Deploy using the provided scripts, ensuring to review and understand their actions.

### [](#optimistic-depositswithdrawals-7)Optimistic Deposits/Withdrawals

The protocol offers an “optimistic” mode for processing deposits and withdrawals based on projected pool jetton/TON ratios, facilitating immediate transactions while ensuring protection against potential validator cheating attempts. Special considerations such as “Fill or Kill” and “Immediate withdrawals” are implemented to accommodate nominator preferences and liquidity requirements.

### [](#conclusion-8)Conclusion

The Liquid Staking protocol revolutionizes TON blockchain validation by fostering a collaborative ecosystem between TON holders and node operators. Through the strategic pooling of assets, the protocol not only enhances the validation process but also contributes to the broader DeFi landscape, offering a robust framework for asset management, reward distribution, and governance within the TON blockchain.

To begin with injecting liquidity into this Project,  
**Step 1:** The Ownership Coin platform introduces a unique approach for $OC MiningBot minting (as NFT), where every new user must acquire 1 $OC token from an existing miner. This system ensures a self-sustaining liquidity ecosystem, as the influx of new miners necessitates the purchase of $OC tokens from current participants. This model not only incentivizes early mining efforts but also fosters a continuously expanding liquidity pool, enhancing the ecosystem’s vibrancy and stability as the user base grows.

**Step 2:** The OC Project will roll out a world-wide Mining Speed (MS) Competition in 3 categories (3 Hour | 6 Hours | 12 Hours) as the world wide awareness campaign for the $OC and to grow the organise user base.

**Step 3** We will then introduce the first use case of the $OC by launching :

It would be great to have a thread with ideas and best practices for growing your community.

What are some unique ways you have seen good growth on your projects and their communities?

 

[Captain\_Rockstar](https://tonresear.ch/u/Captain_Rockstar) June 5, 2024, 9:35am  2

Hey PopRocks!

I have many tricks to quickly grow a community.

*   Post daily quality human made content
*   Gather a team of volunteers within the community to support the content
*   Subscribe to telemetr combot, tonsoffriends and other annuary.
*   Be active on the chat answer the community, boostrap conversations, have fun!
*   Brand you group with stickers, meme, images, tell a story.
*   Be a charismatic person, the best web3 friend everyone wants to have.

idk if we can share links here but let’s try, here are my group & channel, 1 month old both. Ton French community.

# [Enhancing TON Blockchain Security with The Locker Contract](/t/enhancing-ton-blockchain-security-with-the-locker-contract/201)

[Application](/c/application/20) 

    

[Vegeta](https://tonresear.ch/u/Vegeta)  February 4, 2024, 1:09pm  1

### [](#introduction-1)Introduction

The Locker Contract introduces a secure mechanism for locking and unlocking TON deposits, coupled with reward distribution, in a structured and time-bound manner. This innovative smart contract system is designed to facilitate users in making deposits, accruing rewards, and strategically unlocking their investments over predetermined periods. This comprehensive guide delves into the functionalities, operational procedures, and technical nuances of The Locker Contract, aiming to offer clarity and guidance for users looking to engage with this system on the TON blockchain.

### [](#core-functionalities-2)Core Functionalities

The Locker Contract is equipped with a set of features designed to ensure a seamless and secure interaction for users:

Functionality

Description

Total Coins Locked

Displays the cumulative amount of TON deposits by all users.

Total Reward

Indicates the total reward pool available in nanotons.

Deposit and Reward Timeline

Specifies the timeframe for accepting deposits and rewards, delineating start and end times.

Vesting Schedule

Outlines the vesting start time, total duration, and unlock periods for deposited funds.

### [](#operational-guide-3)Operational Guide

#### [](#making-deposits-4)Making Deposits

Users can make deposits by sending a minimum of 50 TON to the contract with a specific text comment. These deposits are credited after deducting 1 TON for network costs. The system allows for multiple deposits, aggregating the total amount per user.

#### [](#reward-contributions-5)Reward Contributions

Similar to deposits, rewards are added by sending funds to the contract, accompanied by a designated text comment. These contributions enhance the total reward pool, which is proportionally distributed among users based on their deposit amounts.

#### [](#unlocking-and-withdrawing-funds-6)Unlocking and Withdrawing Funds

The Locker Contract employs a vesting schedule to unlock deposits over time, allowing users to withdraw their funds incrementally. Withdrawal requests are made through sending a transaction to the contract, which then processes the unlocked amount for disbursement.

### [](#smart-contracts-structure-7)Smart Contracts Structure

The ecosystem comprises two pivotal contracts:

*   **Locker**: The primary contract holding all deposits and rewards.
*   **Locker-bill**: An auxiliary contract managing individual user deposits for efficient data handling.

### [](#technical-overview-8)Technical Overview

#### [](#project-composition-9)Project Composition

*   `contracts`: Contains the source code for The Locker Contract and associated dependencies.
*   `wrappers`: Provides wrapper classes for seamless interaction with the contracts.
*   `tests`: Ensures contract reliability through comprehensive testing.
*   `scripts`: Facilitates contract deployment and other operational tasks.

#### [](#deployment-and-usage-10)Deployment and Usage

To engage with The Locker Contract, users must follow a straightforward process involving code compilation, testing, and deployment. Initial setup requires sending 1 TON to the contract for storage purposes.

### [](#conclusion-11)Conclusion

The Locker Contract on the TON blockchain offers a robust framework for managing deposits, rewards, and the strategic release of funds. By adhering to the outlined procedures and leveraging the provided functionalities, users can securely participate in this system, benefiting from a structured approach to investment on the TON platform. With its meticulous design and operational transparency, The Locker Contract represents a significant advancement in blockchain finance management.

# [Implementing N-of-M Multisignature Wallets in Blockchain Systems](/t/implementing-n-of-m-multisignature-wallets-in-blockchain-systems/202)

[Application](/c/application/20) 

[multisig](https://tonresear.ch/tag/multisig)

    

[Vegeta](https://tonresear.ch/u/Vegeta)   February 4, 2024, 2:12pm  1

The evolution of blockchain technology has introduced innovative ways to enhance security and flexibility in transaction management. Among these, the concept of multisignature (multisig) wallets stands out, providing a robust mechanism for executing transactions. This document delves into the technical architecture and operational framework of an N-of-M multisig wallet system, designed to require at least N out of a predefined set of M signers (participants) to approve an order for its execution. Such wallets facilitate a wide range of transactions, from simple transfers to complex administrative functions, thereby offering an elevated level of security and versatility.

## [](#overview-1)Overview

Multisignature wallets are advanced cryptographic schemes that enforce a group consensus before executing any transaction. This system is particularly beneficial in managing collective funds, ensuring that no single entity can unilaterally control the assets. The following table summarizes the key components of the multisig wallet system:

Component

Description

Signers

Independent entities authorized to approve order executions. Signers can be individuals, hardware wallets, or other smart contracts with their own logic.

Proposers

Entities permitted to suggest new orders but not to approve them. This role is designed to facilitate the submission of transactions without granting full control.

Multisig

The smart contract that executes approved orders, holding the assets and permissions. It also tracks the number of orders and the current sets of Signers and Proposers.

Orders

Child contracts representing individual transactions. Each order contains its content and the approvals from Signers.

## [](#operational-flow-2)Operational Flow

The process for executing a transaction within the multisig wallet framework involves several steps:

1.  A proposer creates a new order comprising various transactions from the Multisig address and requests the Multisig to initiate the approval process.
2.  The Multisig verifies the request’s authenticity, deploys a child sub-contract (Order) containing the order’s details, and awaits approvals.
3.  Signers independently send approval messages to the Order contract.
4.  Upon receiving sufficient approvals, the Order contract requests the Multisig to execute the order.
5.  The Multisig authenticates the Order and verifies the Signers’ set’s relevance before executing the transaction.
6.  Orders requiring more than 255 transactions are processed through an `internal_execute` mechanism, ensuring all transactions are completed efficiently.
7.  The Multisig validates and continues execution of transactions initiated by itself, ensuring a secure and closed-loop operation.

## [](#guarantees-3)Guarantees

The multisig wallet system offers several security guarantees:

*   Only authorized proposers and signers can initiate and approve new orders, respectively.
*   Any change in the signers’ set invalidates all existing orders, ensuring alignment with current permissions.
*   Compromise of fewer than N signers does not prevent the execution of orders or the proposal of new ones, including those that would remove compromised signers.
*   The wallet’s logic is immutable post-deployment, ensuring consistent operational integrity.

## [](#implementation-details-4)Implementation Details

The project structure is organized as follows:

*   `contracts`: Contains the source code for all smart contracts and their dependencies.
*   `wrappers`: Provides wrapper classes for contracts, including serialization/deserialization functions and compilation utilities.
*   `tests`: Houses tests for validating the contracts’ functionality.
*   `scripts`: Includes deployment scripts and other utility scripts for project management.

### [](#usage-instructions-5)Usage Instructions

To build, test, and deploy the multisig wallet, the following commands are utilized:

*   **Build**: Execute `npx blueprint build` or `yarn blueprint build` to compile the contracts.
*   **Test**: Use `npx blueprint test` or `yarn blueprint test` to run the test suite.
*   **Deploy/Run Scripts**: To deploy the contracts or run other scripts, use `npx blueprint run` or `yarn blueprint run`.

This document outlines the technical and operational framework of the N-of-M multisig wallet system, emphasizing its security features and flexibility in managing blockchain transactions. Through careful implementation and adherence to the outlined processes, the multisig wallet serves as a powerful tool for enhancing transaction security and consensus within blockchain networks.

PIZZA is a truly community driven meme coin that unites people in their aim to make PIZZA great and tasty!

With PIZZA, one can really feel that every member of the community matters, that crypto is not just about buy low sell high and hope to not get rekt do nothing in between, but it’s about creating and developing yourself, together, as a community.

Besides this, PIZZA is a fun and hilarious reminder of the fact that someone spent 6000 GRAM on a pizza irl. For such a price, that must have been a very tasty pizza!

Just like our PIZZA. Veeery TATSY.

**TONALD TRUMP ($TONALD) (3.5m Market Cap)**

**Project Twitter**: [x.com](https://x.com/Tonaldonton)

**Project Telegram:** [Telegram: Contact @TONALD\_TRUMP](https://t.me/TONALD_TRUMP)

**Project Description:**

$TONALD Trump merges the vibrant energy of MAGA culture with the advanced technology and ethos of Telegram’s TON blockchain. More than just a digital currency, $TONALD is designed to support Pavel Durov’s vision of freedom, privacy, and community engagement.

Holders of $TONALD have exclusive access to participate in meme-related activities, acquire unique physical merchandise, and own limited-edition NFTs. This opportunity not only helps to grow the community but also provides our token holders with a genuine stake in the evolving ecosystem. By integrating entertainment, technology, and community-driven initiatives, $TONALD stands as a unique bridge between narrative and blockchain innovation.

**Token Distribution**: The team currently holds roughly 7% of circulating supply

**LP** = 100% Burnt

**Roadmap:**

Over the next 6-12 months, the Tonald Team aims to significantly enhance the Ton ecosystem and provide substantial value to its investors. Tonald is not just a meme; we are committed builders on the Ton blockchain, delivering value beyond technology. Our goal is to unite two narratives: MAGA and the “Digital Resistance.”

**AI Bot**

We’ve already launched phase 1 of our roadmap, introducing a custom Tonald AI bot in our Telegram group. The “/Tonald” bot emulates the real Donald Trump, allowing you to converse with it as if you were talking to Trump himself. Give it a try here ([Telegram: Contact @TONALD\_TRUMP](https://t.me/TONALD_TRUMP)).

**NFTs**

Our NFTs will be distributed across 10 different collections in which we dedicate 100% of proceeds from sales to 10 different organizations chosen by our community. Just to name a few, this will include the Trump presidential campaign, the National Veterans Foundation, Homes for Our Troops, & The Fisher House Foundation. Our website will be updated weekly to reflect the total amount donated.

Every NFT purchase will come with a “TON Blue” colored MAGA hat shipped directly to you!

We are also developing our own mint function, allowing you to purchase NFTs directly with your $TONALD tokens.

**Staking - Tonald DAO**

We will implement a staking feature that enables you to stake your NFTs and earn $TONALD tokens. Stakers will gain access to our community voting mechanism for various topics.

**The Apprentice Show**

We plan to host a spin-off of Trump’s “The Apprentice” show on a weekly Twitter Space. The show will feature both existing projects and new initiatives looking to build on TON. A panel of hosts will interview the participants, ultimately selecting one winner. The winner will receive a monetary prize and a spot in our incubator program, designed to help projects grow.

The Tonald DAO will be used to elect the winner of each week’s show.

**Tonald Bot**

We have a fully functional sniper bot ready to deploy. However, our immediate priority is to grow our community and solidify our position within the TON ecosystem. Once we launch the bot, 50% of the profits from trading fees will be donated to the previously mentioned organizations, while the remaining 50% will be shared with our holders as revenue share.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to build and innovate!

I’ve been on this project since firelaunch. Very attracted by the stable token price, calm, friendly and structured community. The founder has a lot of ideas for the development of the project, which are being systematically implemented. There is a DAO chat where the founder publishes his ideas for the community to discuss. Recently, a game based on the Saudi quest of oil extraction has been launched. In my opinion, the project has a great future, shaped by the joint efforts of the founder and the community ![:heart:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/heart.png?v=12 ":heart:") ![:heart:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/heart.png?v=12 ":heart:") ![:heart:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/heart.png?v=12 ":heart:")

Our liquidity pool was formed after the launch of a jetton on the tonnraffles platform. Lliquidity pool is uploaded to the [dedust.io](http://dedust.io) dex. Liquidity pool is growing organically, we do not boost it additionally.

## [](#your-plans-6)Your Plans

We specialize in creating various bots that can be useful in the TON ecosystem. At the moment we have ready - a bot for organizing access to private chats of holders and a bot that displays all token transactions. A bot for mass distribution of TONs and jettons will be ready soon.

*   [Telegram: Contact @liberta\_chatbot](http://t.me/liberta_chatbot)
*   [Telegram: Contact @free\_swapbot](http://t.me/free_swapbot) (you can see the work of the bot in the chat - [Telegram: Contact @freedom\_ton\_chat](http://t.me/freedom_ton_chat)).

In the future we also plan to develop bots, with monetization for our jetton $FREE

We realize that our performance is still not enough for the Open League, but we still leave the application because we believe that our project can benefit the TON blockchain.

A great project with good utilities. Freedom is just at the beginning of its journey, the guys from the freedom team are creating good utilities that can help the token develop in the future. Therefore, the token has great prospects. The creator of the project is always in touch, quick to respond, responsible and honest. Users from the freedom chat, very satisfied, will always answer all questions. I really like the Freedom crypto project, as I see great prospects in it.

For me, as a newcomer to crypto this is one of the most interesting projects. Its strength lies in the strong community and enthusiasm of the developers. They always answer any questions quickly and honestly and know their business well.

I believe FREE has huge prospects, and the game announcement and excellent NFT collection will help it grow faster than its competitors.

Free is an interesting project, I advise everyone to take a closer look. There are good chances that it will give a lot of profit to the holders.

\*The NFT collection is released  
\*An interesting game is in development  
\*The team is always in touch with the community.  
\*The community has a friendly atmosphere.  
\*The price of the coin is low, but at any moment it can rise in price.

I wish success to FREE community and development team. To the moon and higher!

A fundamental project for the entire TON ecosystem. The first and the only project at the current moment that allows each TON user to create pools for any token with no need to spend money and time on creating his own smart contract. The code is open source and has been successfully passed an independent audit recently.

And there is even MORE to come.

I strongly recommend everyone interested to read the White Paper at least.

Wish the team to success!

## [](#your-plans-8)Your Plans

The [FollowDragons](https://t.me/dragons_ton) ecosystem has been evolving on TON for over two years now! Our team is actively working on developping strong community, improving our infrastructure and moving towards mass adoption!

For over a year, we have been working on the P2E game [LEAGUE of DRAGONS](https://t.me/LEAGUEofDRAGONSbot), actively enhancing the infrastructure and developing the product!  
Our goal is mass integration of non-crypto audiences into the TON blockchain and optimizing audience attraction to our FollowDragons ecosystem! Currently, the LEAGUE of DRAGONS audience counts over 1300 players, and the game is in the Beta testing stage!

As part of our marketing campaign, we launched our utility meme-coin Dracoin, $DRA, during the Year of the Dragon!  
This coin not only symbolizes the Year of the Dragon but also has a range of prospects due to its diverse applications - DRA will be integrated into LoD as special currency and will also participate in a number of unique mechanics from FollowDragons!

Currently, the TVL of Dracoin is $23,000 | 4400 ton, half of which is personally contributed by the FollowDragons ecosystem and locked for a year! Our goal is to expand the dragon ecosystem, increase the number of players in the Dragon game, and promote the spread of information about FollowDragons with Dracoin!

FollowDragons on TON has been around for over two years now! And the Dracoin story is just beginning!

By submitting the form I confirm that the data I provided is correct and I fully understand that in case of the contrary, my project will be permanently eliminated from The Open League.

Recently I came across an ancient bot, which stated that on July 28, 2022 ![:face_with_peeking_eye:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/face_with_peeking_eye.png?v=12 ":face_with_peeking_eye:") , I was trying to collect free points for the dragon freemint from the first version of the NFT collection. Of course, nothing came of it then, but I stayed in the project. Later, I minted NFT and fully joined the community.  
At that time, thanks to dragons, it was possible to participate in the purchase of nft other collections at a discount.

Over these two years, the project not only did not close, but also grew significantly.  
Now, this is also a telegram game in which it is interesting to spend time and earn money. This is a community of people on Telegram with whom it is interesting to communicate. Telegram channels and chats, with news about events in other projects and a collection. Dragons have their own coin that everyone needs to hold! And much more.

**Long life and growth to the project!**

    > ALPM Algorithm
    
    **Advanced Liquidity Management**  
    BBG uses an AI-based automated liquidity pool management system to analyze market data on the TON network in real-time and manage liquidity efficiently. This enables the execution of optimal liquidity provision strategies on the TON blockchain, allowing users to manage assets more effectively. Additionally, Telegram bots enhance user experience by providing easy access.
    
    **Maximizing Fee Revenue**  
    The service is designed to maximize transaction fee revenue for liquidity providers on the TON network. By supplying liquidity on the TON blockchain, users can achieve high returns without additional management. The service is user-friendly, as users can easily monitor and manage liquidity pool status via Telegram bots.
    
    **Optimal Liquidity Pool Recommendation**  
    By analyzing various TON decentralized exchanges(DEXs), the service recommends the most advantageous DEX for providing liquidity. This helps liquidity providers on the TON blockchain allocate assets most efficiently, maximizing returns. Real-time optimal liquidity pool recommendations are easily accessible through Telegram bots, enhancing user convenience.
    
    **Concentrated Liquidity Provision**  
    The service ensures low slippage and a stable trading experience by providing concentrated liquidity on the TON network. This reduces transaction costs on the TON blockchain and improves user satisfaction. The use of models like Uniswap V3 for concentrated liquidity provision ensures lower slippage and stable trades. Users can easily manage liquidity provision through Telegram bots, increasing accessibility.
    
    **Continuous Income Opportunities**  
    Collaborating with other TON DeFi protocols, the service provides continuous income opportunities for liquidity providers on the TON blockchain. This allows users to expect stable long-term returns on the TON network. Offering additional incentives for providing liquidity increases user participation, with easy access through Telegram further encouraging engagement.
    
    **Next-Level Liquidity Utilization**  
    The service introduces features that allow liquidity to be used as collateral for additional loans on the TON network, enabling liquidity providers to generate greater returns on the TON blockchain. This expands the rewards from merely transaction fees to additional returns through collateral loans. These services are easily accessible via Telegram bots, allowing for quick utilization.
    
    **Providing a Safe and Transparent Trading Environment**  
    Utilizing the TON network’s on-chain protocols and smart contracts, the service guarantees transaction transparency and security. This ensures that liquidity providers on the TON blockchain can trade in a trusted environment and protect their assets. Transparency in trading processes is maintained through Telegram bots, enabling users to monitor and access services easily.

[TON Blockchain](/c/ton-blockchain/17) 

    

[ASURADA](https://tonresear.ch/u/ASURADA)  February 5, 2024, 3:12am  1

## [](#introduction-1)Introduction

The TON (The Open Network) blockchain has introduced an innovative mechanism to strengthen its ecosystem and tokenomics through the TON Believers Fund, also known as The Locker. This initiative encourages users to lock their Toncoin (TON) into a dedicated smart contract, aiming to reduce circulating supply, enhance token stability, and reward long-term commitment.

## [](#ton-believers-fund-overview-2)TON Believers Fund Overview

The TON Believers Fund represents a strategic approach to engage the community and stabilize the token’s economy. By locking TON tokens into a smart contract for a fixed period, participants contribute to the network’s growth while gaining potential rewards. This initiative has garnered significant attention, amassing a substantial portion of the total TON supply.

## [](#key-features-and-operation-3)Key Features and Operation

Deposits accepted until October 23, 2023.

**Minimum Contribution**

50 TON for both deposits and donations.

**Participation Method**

Via direct wallet transactions to a specified address, with specific text comments for deposits (“d”) and donations (“r”).

## [](#impact-on-ton-ecosystem-4)Impact on TON Ecosystem

The success of the TON Believers Fund is evident in its substantial collection of over 1.3 billion TON, approximately 25% of the total supply. This initiative not only demonstrates the community’s support but also plays a crucial role in reducing circulating supply, potentially leading to an appreciation in TON’s price.

The locked TON tokens represent a substantial portion of the supply, underscoring the community’s belief in the project’s long-term value.

## [](#conclusion-7)Conclusion

The TON Believers Fund is a testament to the strength and commitment of the TON community. By locking a significant amount of TON tokens, participants are not only supporting the network’s growth but also positioning themselves to benefit from potential token appreciation. This initiative marks a significant step towards achieving a more stable and transparent tokenomics, fostering confidence among current and prospective members of the TON ecosystem.

Игра с интересной механикой, есть роли на любой вкус: энергетик, майнер или инвестор. На мой взгляд в основу игры заложена интересная экономическая модель, которая призвана формировать спрос и предложение на внутриигровом маркете. Если у вас максимально серьезный подход, можно уйти в расчеты оптимальной стратегии, надолго засев за excel таблицы. Это касается лишь любителей посчитать. Пока не все правила озвучены, разработчики сохраняют интригу, что подогревает интерес. С любопытством жду развития проекта, который согласно планам рассчитан более, чем на год. Верю в успех проекта. Игра началась…

# [Tontix Web 3.0 Revolution](/t/tontix-web-3-0-revolution/24305)

[General](/c/general/4) 

    

[Tontix](https://tonresear.ch/u/Tontix)   June 10, 2024, 2:23pm  1

Hey, entertainment enthusiasts! Have you heard the buzz about the latest innovation set to shake up the entertainment industry? Let me fill you in on the game-changing concept that’s got everyone talking.

So, picture this: it’s a conference in Hong Kong, and the spotlight is on Luke, the founder of Tontix, as he takes the stage. He’s not just there to give any old spiel – he’s about to drop some serious knowledge bombs on how entertainment is stepping into the future with Web 3.0.  

[![photo_2024-04-25_13-56-38](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/8/8cfe59c653bc9beb700dd5ab2d71c48812fa0d2b_2_690x229.jpeg)

](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8cfe59c653bc9beb700dd5ab2d71c48812fa0d2b.jpeg "photo_2024-04-25_13-56-38")

  
Luke kicks things off by painting a vivid picture of how entertainment isn’t just about watching movies or attending concerts anymore – it’s a whole experience. It’s about passion, dreams, and forming connections with our favorite stars and stories. But here’s the kicker: despite its importance, the entertainment industry has hit a plateau. The audience is dwindling, especially among the younger crowd, and the pandemic hasn’t done it any favors.

Enter **Tontix**. Luke breaks it down for us: the traditional ways of ticketing and distribution are so last decade. We’re talking about Ticketing 1.0, Ticketing 2.0 on social networks like WeChat or Facebook and now, the big reveal – _Web 3.0_ through **Tontix**. It’s time to shake off the old-school mindset and embrace a new era of entertainment that’s decentralized, interactive, and downright revolutionary.

But what does this mean for us, the fans? Well, for starters, it’s all about participation. Gone are the days of passively consuming content – we want to be part of the action. Just look at the rise of fan clubs and social media communities, where we’re not just fans, we’re creators too. And with **Tontix** leading the charge, we’re on the brink of a whole new level of involvement. Imagine being able to shape the plot of a movie or direct the story-line of a show – talk about next-level entertainment!

But wait, there’s more. **Tontix** isn’t just shaking things up for the sake of it – they’re paving the way for a more inclusive, community-driven entertainment landscape. With tools like Telegram and TON, they’re giving content creators, marketers, venues, and, most importantly, us, the audience, a seat at the table. It’s like “creative communism,” where everyone has a stake in the game and benefits from the content they love.

And let’s not forget about the marketing side of things. **Tontix** isn’t just about making it easier to buy tickets – they’re revolutionizing the way we discover and engage with entertainment. From building awareness to driving sales and everything in between, they’ve got it covered. And with features like reviews and pre-booking functions, they’re turning the audience into the ultimate marketing force.

So, what’s next for **Tontix**? Well, the sky’s the limit. With their Telegram Bot demo and show performance chapter, they’re giving us a taste of what’s to come. Whether it’s following our favorite stars or sharing our favorite scenes, **Tontix** is putting the power in our hands and redefining what it means to be an entertainment consumer.

In the end, it’s clear that **Tontix** isn’t just a game-changer – it’s a game-changer with a purpose. By embracing _Web 3.0_ and putting the audience front and center, they’re not just revolutionizing entertainment – they’re reinventing it. So here’s to **Tontix**, and here’s to the future of entertainment. Get ready to be part of something big – the revolution starts now!

First of all, TON FISH is the very best memecoin on the TON Blockchain.

On top of that, it is the TON memecoin project that has the largest community; one big FISH family!

Most importantly, TON FISH is always giving back to their community; always! And it’s a beautiful thing.

The TON FISH BOX is a unique collection with great utility in the TON FISH ecosystem; and for me, it is one of the greatest NFTs in the entire TON Blockchain!

TON FISH has my support, now and forever!

I love TON FISH and I’m swimming to FISH paradise, for sure!

Приветствую, друзья! ![:wave:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/wave.png?v=12 ":wave:")

В чем же преимущество и отличие от конкурентов (конкурентов нет, мы первые в своем роде):

![:chart_with_upwards_trend:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/chart_with_upwards_trend.png?v=12 ":chart_with_upwards_trend:") Теперь не нужно постоянно следить за курсом монет.

![:microscope:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/microscope.png?v=12 ":microscope:") За вас это сделает [Crypt Watch Bot](https://t.me/CryptWatchBot)

![:coin:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/coin.png?v=12 ":coin:") От вас требуется только ввести адрес монеты и верхнюю/нижнюю границы курса.

![:spider_web:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/spider_web.png?v=12 ":spider_web:") Для WEB3 - это EQBtcL4JA-PdPiUkB8utHcqdaftmUSTqdL8Z1EeXePLti\_nK

![:warning:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/warning.png?v=12 ":warning:") Как только будет достигнута заданная граница, бот сразу же уведомит вас.

Теперь немного подробнее о боте:

![:white_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:") Отслеживает курс только монет, торгующих в паре с TON

Сопротивление 300,

Токен имеет 1 десятичный знак. так что 1 $TR300 можно разделить максимум на 10.

Если люди заплатят за 0,18 токенов, они получат 1 токен, а 0,08 пойдут в пул LP. Это полностью экспериментально. Каждый волен что-то строить или устанавливать.

У токена нет официальной команды, все купили его честно

The Resistance 300,

The token has 1 decimal. so 1 $TR300 can be split into 10 at most.  
If people pay for 0.18 tokens they will get 1 token and 0.08 will go to the LP pool. It’s totally experimental.

Everyone is free to build or establish something.

The token has no official team, everyone bought it fairly.

# [Wonnie - bear uniting memcoins](/t/wonnie-bear-uniting-memcoins/24780)

[The Open League](/c/the-open-league/token-leaderboard/57)  [Token Battle](/c/the-open-league/token-leaderboard/57) 

    

[Topper](https://tonresear.ch/u/Topper)  June 11, 2024, 7:37am  1

*   Token Name - Wonnie
*   Project’s Twitter [x.com](https://twitter.com/Wonnie_TON)
*   We are creating an infrastructure project on the TON blockchain, using the popular Wonnie meme as a go-to-market strategy.

Wonnie is a symbol of a successful trader. He is not just a crypto businessman, but an example of how you can become a dollar billionaire without experiencing drawdowns in your portfolio, in which more than 90% are shieldcoins.

The problem that the project solves:

There are currently too many meme coins appearing on the TON blockchain. These coins are attracting the attention of people hoping for a quick profit.

Solution:

Our platform works like a social network, adding mechanics for the growth, development and burning of partners’ meme coins. Partners no longer need to come up with a product and worry about supporting it - all meme coins will be able to promote one platform.

About the platform:

The following types of users will be represented on the platform:

1.  Users
    
2.  Authors
    
3.  Projects
    
4.  Users:
    

Anyone can connect their wallet to the platform and gain access to the following features:

1.1 Bets on the outcome of events from the authors (whether the idea will work or not). If the bet works, you receive tokens from the losing side in proportion to the bet (like a pool).

1.2 Flipper: Wonnie is our trader and gambler, so we will create a mini-game with a 40% chance of doubling your bet. If a person loses, he receives 30% cashback from the loss amount (the smart contract redeems from the glass). If he wins, the smart contract buys tokens from the glass.

1.3 Staking: staking will be implemented with access to quests, upgrading your avatar, increasing cashback, social and on-chain quests with rewards.

2.  Authors:

To become an author and publish posts (ideas) on the platform, you need to have an NFT, which is embedded in your profile avatar. After this, the profile becomes the author, and depending on the rarity of the NFT, the platform gives a percentage of the project commission (10% commission from the losing side). The rarer the NFT, the higher the percentage (from 50% to 99.9%). The author can make forecasts on the market and projects. People vote on whether the idea will pass or not, but the author still gets his percentage from the losing side.

3.  Projects:

In order for a project to be presented on the platform, it must buy Wonnie and stake them. Depending on the amount of staking, the platform functions are opened to the project (the ability to place bets with the project’s coin, receive cashback with the project’s token, build a staking system on the project’s token).

Simply put, we came up with a mechanism for burning tokens outsourced. Projects no longer have to worry about how to get their tokens used. They can come to us and we will do everything for them. Their task is to bring their users to our system.

We believe that our platform will become a key element in the TON ecosystem, creating new opportunities for all market participants. ![:rocket:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/rocket.png?v=12 ":rocket:")

Our Hackathon application is here: [TON Map | Buidls | DoraHacks](https://dorahacks.io/buidl/11685)

We participated in two Open League Summer bootcamps offline and presented our project.

The TON Map project introduces an innovative concept combining a map and game integrations, inspired by the success of Sandbox.game and [milliondollarhomepage.com](http://milliondollarhomepage.com/) . By adding TON, accessibility to millions of Telegram users, competitive elements, and modern ideas, TON Map aims to create a lasting impact and offer the opportunity to mine a meme coin.

Each pixel on the TON Map canvas is priced at 1 TON and comes with coordinates, a sequential number, an image, a description, and the owner’s wallet or Telegram username. This allows users to customize their display and showcase their territory on the main TON/Telegram map.

The project serves as a vast advertising platform for projects and individuals in the TON and Telegram ecosystems, offering continuous advertisement on the website, map, and mini-app. It follows the legacy of [milliondollarhomepage.com](http://milliondollarhomepage.com/) while embedding itself in the history of blockchain.

![:heavy_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/heavy_check_mark.png?v=12 ":heavy_check_mark:") Each pixel, besides being priced at 1 TON, has coordinates (999x999), a sequential number (0 - 999 999), an image, a description, the wallet or Telegram username of the owner, and a link. All of this is publicly accessible on the map to every visitor. You can customize what to display.

![:heavy_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/heavy_check_mark.png?v=12 ":heavy_check_mark:") The buying process is extremely simple. Connect your wallet => Buy button => Select one or multiple pixels => Confirm the transaction.

![:heavy_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/heavy_check_mark.png?v=12 ":heavy_check_mark:") Now, on the main TON/Telegram map, you have your place, your land, your advertising space, and a place for self-expression. And, of course, access to the full functionality of our Mini-app in Telegram.

![:heavy_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/heavy_check_mark.png?v=12 ":heavy_check_mark:") Everyone will have the opportunity to showcase their territories, the most exquisite and rare pixels, and simply the status of the most successful NFT owner on TON.

The conceptual aspects of the project:

*   A vast advertising and game platform for projects and people in TON and Telegram (advertisement on the website, on the map, in the mini-app, continuously, for years).
*   Play games (A lot of games from the MAP to TMA)
*   A significant experiment; owning a pixel is prestigious. You can receive discounts on goods and bonuses from partners.
*   Embed yourself in the history of blockchain.
*   Your personal corner/metaverse in TON.
*   You can buy now, and sell later with conversion to NFT.
*   Every pixel owner will be able to mine a coin within the application with bonuses.
*   Bridge to onboard TON users on Near through Punks

### [](#mission-10)Mission.

The mission of TON Map is to be the new Sandbox on TON and to provide users with a massive advertising platform, leaving a lasting mark in history for both the project and each user, while spreading TON to the masses.

The project engages users through various activities such as referral programs, coin claims, completing tasks, boosting cities, and renting out pixels.

### [](#activity-11)Activity.

*   Referral for coins, which can be exchanged for TON (10%).
*   Coin claims once every N hours, which will receive liquidity from TON staking and USDT.
*   Completing tasks for coins.
*   Boosting cities (channels) and their movement to the top.
*   Renting out your pixels.
*   Other activities under development.

### [](#tokenomics-12)Tokenomics

Tokenomics involve coin farming, voting for denominations, and token rollout, with a portion of the funds allocated to staking mechanisms. At least 50% of the proceeds from pixel sales will be invested back into the ecosystem.

The plan is to release approximately 50,000 - 100,000 TON for token liquidity (assuming all pixels are sold). Additionally, a significant portion of the funds will be allocated to various staking mechanisms to ensure a consistent flow of funds into token liquidity and project development.

Target audience: Telegram and TON users, who want to advertise their project on the canvas, or inscribe themselves into history

In my opinion TON Frogs can be a symbol for TON blockchain NFTS, and I am going to tell you why:

1\_ Unique and amazing 3D design which unlike most of the collections on TON is not COPY!

2\_ one of the oldest and amazing community on TON ( everyone are welcome to that)

3\_ An active team with cool plans

By TON Frogs we will show the other people on the other blockchains how cool we are!!! ![:slight_smile:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12 ":slight_smile:")

Tinu the number one meme/utility coin on TON!

Can someone from TON explain why $TINU has not been added yet?

Cause looking at other jettons that joined the league already, it is really weird.

# [你知道嗎？在FunC中，1並不等於1](/t/func-1-1/24995)

[中文 (简繁)](/c/zh/48) 

[func](https://tonresear.ch/tag/func), [learn](https://tonresear.ch/tag/learn)

    

[ipromise2324](https://tonresear.ch/u/ipromise2324)   June 11, 2024, 3:42pm  1

嗨大家好，我和 [@Alan](/u/alan) 在撰寫測試 FunC 的一個合約，發現了一個很有趣的現象，不曉得是不是 FunC 的 bug，這是我們執行的程式碼:  

[![image](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/6c31fb55ffce06dc3100c3bab4bba28994cf672c_2_690x254.jpeg)

](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6c31fb55ffce06dc3100c3bab4bba28994cf672c.jpeg "image")

我們呼叫這個 function 時，帶入的 `index` 參數為 `0`，因此 `claim_bit_index = 0 % 256`，也就是 `claim_bit_index = 0`，則 `int mask = 1 << 0`，也就是 `mask = 1`。

當我們開始拿 `mask` 變數開始去做一些比對，發現下列有趣的情況：`mask` 目前等於 `1`，但若是拿他來跟 `mask == 1`，dump 出來的結果卻是 `0`，這和預料的結果不太一樣，他應該是 `-1`，因為 `mask = 1`，而 `1 == 1`。接著再拿 `mask ≠ 1` 進行比較，dump 出來的結果就變成 `-1`，這也和常理相反。

下方是我跑程式的結果輸出：  

[![image](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/bf6db52a9f02d6de380eb8c5a6d0224cab04b43b_2_651x500.jpeg)

](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e75de68395ff50de45aff1c86cfe530461502328.jpeg "image")

但我們發現我做了一個操作後，可以讓 `mask == 1` 以及 `mask != 1` 得到正確的結果，也就是在做完位元運算後多 `/ 1`，也就是 `int mask = (1 << claim_bit_index) / 1;`。

透過這樣更改可以得到下方的結果:

這樣的結果不知道是碰到什麼問題了？想和大家一起討論看看這是不是屬於 FunC 的 bugs ??? 還是我們忽略了些什麼問題？！

# [](#what-is-fafafa-moneybag-1)What is FaFaFa? ![:moneybag:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/moneybag.png?v=12 ":moneybag:")

Traditionally, high-yield opportunities were exclusive to quant funds and top asset management firms. FaFaFa democratizes these opportunities, making them accessible to retail investors and smaller institutions through CeDeFi infrastructure. Our platform offers transparent, secure yield-generating products, empowering users to grow their assets.

FaFaFa (FFF), the TON Open League winner, provides a Telegram-based savings account for sustainable income, backed by institutional custody. As a TON-based staking initiative, FFF allows users to stake tokens for credits redeemable for rewards and features the first stablecoin staking on the TON platform.

# [](#advantages-fire-2)Advantages ![:fire:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/fire.png?v=12 ":fire:")

**1\. High Security:** FFF is supported by world-leading institutional custody, ensuring the safety of users’ assets. By utilizing advanced encryption and security protocols, users can confidently stake their tokens on FFF.

**2\. Sustainable Income:** By staking tokens, users can continuously earn credits. These credits can be used to exchange for additional staking rewards. FFF’s design ensures sustainable income, providing users with long-term earning potential.

**3\. Convenient Operations:** The user interface based on Telegram makes FFF very convenient to use. Users can easily stake and manage their accounts through Telegram without complicated procedures.

**4\. TON Blockchain Support:** As a TON blockchain-based project, FFF leverages TON’s efficient and fast transaction characteristics, ensuring quick processing of staking and reward distribution.

# [](#core-features-star2-3)Core Features ![:star2:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/star2.png?v=12 ":star2:")

## [](#save-4)Save

The Save feature allows users to deposit funds into FFF and earn high yields. Currently, the platform supports USDT assets and offers a highly competitive Annual Percentage Yield (APY). With a 90-day APY of up to 28%, FFF outperforms other staking projects, making it an excellent option for staking idle assets. In future, more assets such as TON, NOT, BTC will be supported for staking.

## [](#redeem-5)Redeem

The Redeem feature allows users to withdraw their funds and staking rewards at the end of the staking period. During the staking period, users can also view the details of their staked assets, including the amount staked, staking period, cumulative earnings, and maturity date.

## [](#refer-and-earn-6)Refer and Earn

In FFF, there is a dedication to providing users with the best experience and generous rewards. We have introduced the “Refer and Earn” feature to achieve this. By inviting friends to join FFF, users can earn additional rewards.

## [](#dashboard-7)Dashboard

The dashboard page displays total assets, last 72 hours profit, and total profit, providing a comprehensive view of asset status and earnings.

“Seeds of TON” is a GameFi game focused on socializing, aiming to closely connect players through the TON ecosystem, allowing people to enjoy the fun of planting, cultivation, and socializing while earning generous rewards. This game does not require any specific conditions, and every player can freely explore and experience its rich content.

In the game, players will have the opportunity to obtain various rewards, including NFTs, Coins, unique gifts, and points, which not only enhance the fun of the game but also provide players with more motivation. Currently, “Seeds of TON” is actively being built in the TON ecosystem and is expected to officially meet everyone in early July.

We encourage players to actively invite their friends to join the Seed community and jointly build this vibrant and fun game world. By inviting friends, players can not only expand their social circle but also earn more rewards, achieving a win-win situation. Let’s look forward to the official launch of “Seeds of TON” and invite more friends to join this community full of opportunities and challenges!

## [](#introduction-1)Introduction

This technical documentation presents a comprehensive performance comparison of the TON Blockchain against other leading networks. The analysis focuses on transaction throughput, scalability, and network configuration, highlighting TON’s innovative approach to achieving high transaction per second (TPS) rates.

## [](#ton-blockchain-performance-overview-2)TON Blockchain Performance Overview

The TON Blockchain recently demonstrated remarkable performance in a series of tests, showcasing its potential to outpace traditional blockchains and centralized payment systems. With a confirmed TPS rate of 104,715 on a network configured with 256 validators and 512 shardchains, TON sets a new standard for transaction processing capacity.

### [](#technical-details-6)Technical Details

A detailed examination of TON’s test configuration reveals the use of `ecs.c6.6xlarge` instances on Alibaba Cloud, running on an Ubuntu-based environment. The testnet’s architecture was specifically designed to demonstrate TON’s “Accelerator” update, which includes performance optimizations and feature enhancements.

A unique smart contract was deployed to generate transactional load across the network, simulating real-world usage at scale. The source code for this contract is available for review and further development.

## [](#conclusion-7)Conclusion

TON’s public test showcased not only a groundbreaking TPS rate but also the underlying robustness and adaptability of its network architecture. With TON’s dynamic sharding mechanism and the potential for millions of transactions per second, it represents a significant leap forward in blockchain technology, ready for mass adoption and capable of handling the transactional demands of the future.

# TON Performance Test

On October 31, we proved that TON is the fastest and most scalable blockchain in the world.

During public performance testing on **256** validator nodes, a speed of **104 715** transactions of smart contract execution per second was set. CertiK, the Web3's leading auditor, participated in the event as an independent party and confirmed the results.

The most impressive thing is that the result is far from the limit. TON can handle millions of transactions per second if there are enough validator nodes in the network.

[Charles\_Jones](https://tonresear.ch/u/Charles_Jones)   June 13, 2024, 5:28am  1

Seeds of TON - это социальная игра GameFi, предназначенная для того, чтобы связать игроков через экологию TON, чтобы люди могли зарабатывать огромные награды, наслаждаясь посадкой, развитием и социальными удовольствиями. Игра не требует каких - либо конкретных условий, и каждый игрок может свободно исследовать и испытать ее богатое содержание.  
В игре у игроков будет возможность получить множество наград, в том числе NFT, Coin, уникальные подарки и баллы, которые не только увеличивают интерес к игре, но и дают игрокам больше мотивации. В настоящее время Seeds of TON активно строится в экологии TON и, как ожидается, официально встретится со всеми в начале июля.  
Мы призываем игроков активно приглашать своих друзей присоединиться к сообществу Seed, чтобы построить этот динамичный и веселый игровой мир. Приглашая друзей, игроки могут не только расширить свой социальный круг, но и получить больше наград, чтобы достичь беспроигрышной ситуации. Давайте с нетерпением ждем официального выхода Seeds of TON и пригласим больше друзей присоединиться к этому сообществу возможностей и проблем!

# [Exploring the Technical Nuances of TON Blockchain's Vesting Contract](/t/exploring-the-technical-nuances-of-ton-blockchains-vesting-contract/255)

[Application](/c/application/20) 

    

[Simpson](https://tonresear.ch/u/Simpson)   February 5, 2024, 6:16am  1

In the dynamic landscape of blockchain technology, the TON (The Open Network) Blockchain stands out for its innovative approach to digital asset management, particularly through its vesting contract mechanism. This article delves into the intricate details of the TON Blockchain’s vesting contract, offering a comprehensive analysis that highlights its functionality, parameters, and operational nuances.

**Vesting Contract Overview**

A vesting contract in the TON Blockchain ecosystem is a sophisticated tool designed to lock a predetermined amount of Toncoin for a specific duration, facilitating a gradual release over time. This mechanism ensures a controlled distribution of tokens, aligning with predefined vesting parameters that are immutable post-deployment.

**Vesting Parameters at a Glance**

The vesting parameters, central to the contract’s operation, include:

*   **Total Amount Locked** (`vesting_total_amount`): Specifies the total Toncoins locked, measured in nanotons.
*   **Vesting Start Time** (`vesting_start_time`): Defines the commencement of the vesting period, in Unix time.
*   **Total Vesting Duration** (`vesting_total_duration`): The overall length of the vesting period, in seconds.
*   **Unlock Period** (`unlock_period`): The interval at which tokens begin to unlock, in seconds.
*   **Cliff Duration** (`cliff_duration`): A preliminary period before any tokens are released, in seconds.
*   **Sender and Owner Addresses**: Designate control over the locked Toncoins and their eventual distribution.

The operational integrity of the contract hinges on these parameters meeting specific conditions, ensuring a logical and fair vesting process.

**Mechanics of Locking and Unlocking**

Before the vesting period commences, all tokens remain locked. As the start time arrives, tokens gradually unlock in proportions dictated by the vesting duration and unlock periods. The presence of a cliff duration delays the start of the unlocking process, introducing a phase where no tokens are released.

**Whitelist Functionality**

The vesting contract features a whitelist, allowing locked Toncoins to be sent to specified addresses under certain conditions. This capability facilitates the use of locked tokens for validation or staking purposes, with stringent rules governing transactions to prevent misuse.

**Top-up and Wallet Integration**

Users can add Toncoins to the vesting contract from any address, enhancing flexibility. The contract parallels the standard wallet V3 smart contract, maintaining key wallet functionalities while adapting to the unique requirements of vesting.

**Sending Tokens and Whitelist Restrictions**

Token distribution from the vesting contract is tightly regulated, with specific criteria for transactions to whitelist addresses or the vesting sender address. These measures are in place to safeguard against unauthorized access or token loss.

**Comprehensive Project Structure**

The TON Blockchain’s vesting contract is part of a broader project ecosystem, encompassing contract source code, wrapper classes, tests, and deployment scripts. This structured approach facilitates ease of use, deployment, and integration into various blockchain applications.

**Utilization and Deployment**

Utilizing the vesting contract involves a series of steps from building and testing to deployment, streamlined through the use of development tools like `npx blueprint` and `yarn`. This process underscores the contract’s adaptability and ease of integration into the TON Blockchain environment.

**Conclusion**

The TON Blockchain’s vesting contract represents a pivotal innovation in digital asset management, offering a secure and efficient mechanism for token distribution. Through its comprehensive parameter set, locking and unlocking mechanics, and robust project infrastructure, it provides a scalable solution for managing vested assets within the TON ecosystem. As blockchain technology evolves, the vesting contract stands as a testament to the TON Blockchain’s commitment to innovation, security, and user empowerment.

# [Optimizing Stake Allocation: A Comparative Analysis of the Nominator Pool Smart Contract in TON Blockchain](/t/optimizing-stake-allocation-a-comparative-analysis-of-the-nominator-pool-smart-contract-in-ton-blockchain/257)

[TON Blockchain](/c/ton-blockchain/build-node/21)  [TON Node](/c/ton-blockchain/build-node/21) 

[nominator](https://tonresear.ch/tag/nominator)

    

[Zoro](https://tonresear.ch/u/Zoro)   February 5, 2024, 6:57am  1

In the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology, the TON Blockchain emerges as a forefront contender, particularly when examining the efficiencies and mechanics of its nominator pool smart contract. This article delves into the intricate design, operational parameters, and functionalities of the nominator pool, emphasizing its limits, fees, reward distribution, and the pivotal role of validators and nominators within the ecosystem.

### [](#nominator-pool-design-and-operational-limits-1)Nominator Pool: Design and Operational Limits

The nominator pool smart contract is meticulously engineered for handling substantial coin volumes, prioritizing code safety and simplicity. Its architecture inherently restricts support for minor deposits and limits the nominator count to a maximum of 40, optimizing for a tested configuration of at least 10k TONs per nominator stake.

**Table 1: Operational Limits**

Parameter

Specification

Minimum Nominator Stake

10k TONs

Maximum Nominators

40

Testing Status

Above 40 Not Tested

### [](#financial-considerations-fees-and-reward-distribution-2)Financial Considerations: Fees and Reward Distribution

Operating within the masterchain incurs a substantial fee of approximately 5 TON per validation round, borne by the validator. The reward mechanism is straightforward: post-validation, the pool retrieves its stake plus rewards from the elector, allocating the validator’s share based on a pre-defined parameter, with the remainder distributed among nominators.

**Table 2: Reward Distribution Formula**

Component

Formula

Validator Reward

`(Reward * Validator_Reward_Share) / 10000`

Nominator Reward

`Reward - Validator Reward`

### [](#validator-and-nominator-dynamics-3)Validator and Nominator Dynamics

The pool’s ability to participate in validation hinges on the validator’s funds surpassing both the minimum stake and potential maximum fines, ensuring robustness and accountability in operations. Nominators interact with the pool via simple, bounceable messages, enabling secure transactions and straightforward deposit or withdrawal processes.

**Table 3: Interaction Overview**

Action

Requirement

Deposit

Message with “d” and minimum stake + 1 TON

Withdrawal

Message with “w” and 1 TON for network fee

### [](#governance-and-operational-integrity-4)Governance and Operational Integrity

The pool embodies a transparent governance model, allowing both validators and nominators to vote on network proposals, ensuring democratic decision-making. Operational integrity is safeguarded through the mandatory secure storage of private keys, with emergency protocols in place to maintain functionality and protect participants’ interests.

**Table 4: Governance and Emergency Protocols**

Feature

Description

Voting

Validators and nominators can vote on proposals, with operational messages ensuring pool integrity.

Emergency Withdrawal

Operational messages can be sent by anyone in case of validator inactivity, securing nominators’ assets.

### [](#integration-and-usability-5)Integration and Usability

The smart contract supports seamless integration into wallet applications, facilitating user-friendly interactions for deposits, withdrawals, and voting. This integration empowers users to efficiently manage their investments and participate actively in the pool’s governance.

**Table 5: Wallet Integration Functions**

Functionality

Description

Deposits & Withdrawals

Simple message-based transactions for fund management.

Voting

Message-based voting for network proposals, enhancing community governance.

In conclusion, the nominator pool smart contract within the TON Blockchain offers a sophisticated yet user-centric platform for stake allocation and management. Through its emphasis on security, simplicity, and democratic governance, it stands as a pivotal component in the broader TON ecosystem, enabling stakeholders to optimize their contributions and rewards in the validation process.

Hello team,

Thank you for taking the time to apply for The Open League.

After a thorough review, we must inform you that, unfortunately, we cannot accept you into The Open League due to reputational issues in the TON community and a lack of faith in the team’s ability to deliver based on past history.

Thank you!

Everyone wants to launch coins and memecoins, but liquidity can be a major hurdle, and AMMs aren’t exactly user-friendly. That’s where [Wonton.fun](https://wonton.fun/) comes in!

We’ve built the **fastest** and **cheapest** place for you degens to unleash your inner degen! ![:rocket:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/rocket.png?v=12 ":rocket:") Launch a jetton **in one click** for just **$0.5!**

**How does it work?**

It’s super simple. The jetton is created in **a fair launch**, meaning the dev who creates the jetton has no allocation. They need to buy like everyone else on the market. _We all start from the same line._

The jetton is **immediately tradable** on the bonding curve. The **earlier you buy**, the **lower the price**. As more buyers come, the price goes up. ![:chart_with_upwards_trend:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/chart_with_upwards_trend.png?v=12 ":chart_with_upwards_trend:")

> **GIGA BRAIN NOTE:** If you buy first, there is no way you can lose money as the jetton can never go to zero and never go below the price you bought it at. NFA, but this sounds like a free option! ![:money_with_wings:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/money_with_wings.png?v=12 ":money_with_wings:")

Once the pool reaches a market cap of $69,420 USD (equivalent in TON), trading moves into the AMM! ![:moneybag:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/moneybag.png?v=12 ":moneybag:") We’ve partnered with [Ston.fi](http://Ston.fi) as our DEX!

# [Asynchronous Payment Channels on TON Blockchain: A Technical Deep Dive](/t/asynchronous-payment-channels-on-ton-blockchain-a-technical-deep-dive/258)

[TON Blockchain](/c/ton-blockchain/ton-payment/15)  [TON Payment](/c/ton-blockchain/ton-payment/15) 

    

[Zoro](https://tonresear.ch/u/Zoro)   February 5, 2024, 7:08am  1

**Abstract:**  
In the evolving landscape of blockchain technology, the TON (The Open Network) blockchain stands out for its unique approach to scalability and transaction efficiency. Among its numerous innovations, asynchronous payment channels offer a promising avenue for facilitating instant, cost-free transactions between parties without the burden of on-chain processing. This paper delves into the technical architecture, operational protocols, and practical applications of these payment channels, providing a comprehensive guide for developers and researchers interested in leveraging TON’s capabilities for advanced payment solutions.

![image](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/original/1X/867235652086713cfec3d9b846a069546c42b1c1.png)

**1\. Introduction**  
The TON blockchain introduces asynchronous payment channels as a mechanism to enable rapid, off-chain transactions between two parties. By circumventing the need for blockchain confirmation for each transaction, these channels significantly reduce latency and fees, fostering an environment conducive to microtransactions and continuous financial interactions. This document outlines the construction, operation, and application of these channels, grounded in the latest [func](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/pull/378) and [toncli-local](https://github.com/SpyCheese/ton/tree/toncli-local) versions for development and testing.

**2\. Theoretical Foundation**  
Asynchronous payment channels on TON are predicated on a robust theoretical framework detailed in [Section 5 of TON.pdf](https://ton-blockchain.github.io/docs/ton.pdf#page=111). This foundation underpins the channels’ operational integrity and security, ensuring reliable transactional throughput without compromising on blockchain’s inherent trustlessness.

**3\. Purpose and Benefits**  
The primary objective of these channels is to facilitate a seamless exchange of payments between two parties, minimizing transaction time and costs while ensuring the integrity and security of the exchanges. Unlike traditional on-chain transactions, these channels allow for an unlimited number of off-chain transactions, with on-chain actions required only for channel creation, dispute resolution, and closure.

**4\. Operational Schemes**  
This section elucidates the cooperative and uncooperative operational schemes of asynchronous payment channels, highlighting the mechanisms for channel funding, transaction processing, and closure. Detailed illustrations and descriptions provide insight into the process flows and security measures inherent in these schemes.

*   **4.1 Cooperative Scheme:** This involves mutual agreement on protocol adherence, on-chain fund locking, off-chain transaction processing, and consensus on fund distribution.
*   **4.2 Uncooperative Scheme:** This scheme is activated when disputes arise, detailing the process for dispute resolution, uncooperative closure initiation, and fund distribution based on the latest agreed state.

**5\. Low-Level Operational Details**  
At the heart of the asynchronous payment channels are the semi-channels `A->B` and `B->A`, each characterized by sequence numbers, total sent amounts, and conditional payments. This section dissects the transaction signing process, conditional payment mechanics, and the various smart contract handlers that facilitate the channel’s operations, such as `top_up_balance`, `init_channel`, and `cooperative_close`, among others.

**6\. Interaction Protocol**  
This segment provides a comprehensive guide on the off-chain interaction protocol between parties, covering channel initiation, payment processing, state commitment, and the handling of uncooperative closures. Recommendations are offered to ensure protocol compliance and maximize channel efficiency.

**7\. Contract Interface**  
An in-depth examination of the contract interface reveals the structure and functionality of internal message handlers and data structures. This includes the detailed description of conditional payments, semi-channel bodies, and the sequence of operations for channel management.

**8\. Payment Channel Network**  
Expanding beyond single payment channels, this section explores the potential of a network of interconnected channels. It discusses the mechanism for trustless, multi-hop transactions across the network, enabled by conditional payments and the strategic use of hash functions for secure, intermediary-free fund transfers.

**Conclusion**  
Asynchronous payment channels on the TON blockchain represent a significant leap forward in blockchain scalability and transaction efficiency. By enabling instant, fee-less transactions off-chain, these channels not only alleviate the blockchain’s burden but also open new avenues for microtransactions and continuous payment streams. This paper has provided a technical overview of the channels’ operation, offering valuable insights for developers and researchers aiming to harness TON’s innovative capabilities for advanced financial applications.

# [](#enhancing-microtransactions-a-technical-exploration-of-ton-payment-channels-1)Enhancing Microtransactions: A Technical Exploration of TON Payment Channels

* * *

In the realm of blockchain technology, the Telegram Open Network (TON) presents a groundbreaking approach to facilitating microtransactions through its innovative payment channel mechanism. This article delves into the intricacies of TON Payment Channels, highlighting their efficiency in enabling instant micropayments without incurring fees for each transaction. Through the use of tables and detailed analysis, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the pre-TON payment network’s evolution to the current TON Payment Network, underscoring the technological advancements and their implications for users and developers alike.

#### [](#introduction-to-ton-payment-channels-2)Introduction to TON Payment Channels

TON Payment Channels represent a pivotal development in blockchain technology, offering a means to establish a payment channel between two participants. This setup allows for unlimited instant micropayments to be made between the two parties, with the notable advantage of being free from transaction fees. The only instances where network fees are applied occur during the creation and closure of the payment channel, marking a significant reduction in overall transaction costs.

#### [](#evolution-of-payment-networks-from-pre-ton-to-ton-3)Evolution of Payment Networks: From Pre-TON to TON

The journey from the Pre-TON Payment Network to the TON Payment Network signifies a major leap in blockchain payment systems. Initially, all users were required to establish payment channels via a single intermediate node. This structure facilitated micropayments between users through the intermediary without the need to create new channels for each transaction. The advent of the TON Payment Network introduced a more decentralized approach, incorporating numerous intermediate nodes instead of a singular one. This transition allowed any participant to start an intermediate node and levy a micro-commission on transfers passing through their node, thereby fostering a more robust and flexible payment network.

#### [](#comparative-analysis-pre-ton-vs-ton-payment-network-4)Comparative Analysis: Pre-TON vs. TON Payment Network

#### [](#implications-and-advantages-5)Implications and Advantages

The transition from a centralized intermediary model to a decentralized network of nodes has several implications for the blockchain ecosystem:

*   **Enhanced Scalability**: The ability for any participant to establish an intermediate node significantly scales the network’s capacity for handling transactions.
*   **Reduced Costs**: By circumventing the need for repeated channel creations, users enjoy lower transaction costs, making microtransactions more feasible.
*   **Increased Autonomy**: The decentralized nature of the TON Payment Network empowers users to partake actively in the network’s expansion and governance.

#### [](#conclusion-6)Conclusion

The evolution of TON Payment Channels from a single-intermediary framework to a decentralized network of nodes marks a significant advancement in blockchain technology, particularly in the domain of microtransactions. This development not only enhances transaction efficiency and reduces costs but also promotes a more inclusive and decentralized financial ecosystem. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, the TON Payment Network stands as a testament to the potential for innovative solutions to traditional financial challenges.

Занимаюсь созданием торгового проекта на платформе TON. В данный момент у нас уже есть готовое приложение, и мы планируем провести пресейл нашей собственной торговой монеты.

Наш проект предлагает ликвидные торговые опционы на криптовалюту с лучшими условиями, а также популярные мем-коины с DEX. В проекте будет внедрена система рефералов и сквадов. Планируется 2 типа опционов:  
1- так называемые бинарные т.е по любому страйку выше зоны входа по времени. По ним же будет осуществляться дроп программа за поинты.  
2- по Блеку Шоулзу т.е классические с расчетом онлайн покупки/продажи.

В отличие от других проектов, где клейм механика сводится к простому нажатию кнопки, наш проект предлагает настоящую торговую механику и взаимодействие пользователя с торговлей без риска. Пользователи смогут каждые 12 часов открывать сделки бесплатно по трём инструментам. За успешные сделки они будут получать условные +100 поинтов, а за неуспешные -70 поинтов. Эти поинты затем будут конвертированы в токены пресейла.

Токены пресейла будут использоваться для торговли опционами по популярным парам мем-токенов на TON, которые невозможно шортить на DEX по техническим причинам. Наш коин не будет пустышкой, поскольку он будет поддерживаться платформой и находиться в постоянном обращении. В дальнейшем планируется развитие и добавление новых функций на платформе.

Бета-версия приложения доступна по ссылке: [Telegram: Contact @ton4you\_bot](http://t.me/ton4you_bot/app)

Также у нас будет система сквадов для увеличения вовлечённости пользователей: баллы будут начисляться в зависимости от числа участников в скваде, а также проводиться конкурсы на лучшего трейдера недели и другие мероприятия. Пользователи смогут торговать без вложений и проверять свои рыночные прогнозы ежедневно.

Уже доступна реальная торговля инструментами за TON. Ставки ограничены до 1 TON на позицию до завершения пресейла и программы аирдропа.

Я торгую на рынке с 2011 года и имею опыт работы с различными брокерами и инструментами. Понимаю, что нужно пользователю от платформы: хорошие спреды, качественное исполнение условий и интересные инструменты. На данный момент нет качественных и простых опционов на TON, поэтому я намерен исправить эту ситуацию. Проект рассчитан на долгосрочную перспективу.

Рассматриваю предложения по сотрудничеству и рекламе. [Telegram: Contact @option4you](https://t.me/option4you)

I’m working on creating a trading project on the TON platform. At the moment, we already have a ready-made application, and we plan to conduct a presale of our own trading coin.

Our project offers liquid trading options for cryptocurrency with the best conditions, as well as popular meme coins with DEX. The project will implement a system of referrals and squads. There are 2 types of options planned:  
1- the so-called binary options, i.e., any strike above the entry zone over time. A drop program for points will also be carried out for them.  
2- according to Black-Scholes, i.e., classic options with online purchase/sale calculation.

Unlike other projects where the claim mechanic is reduced to simply pressing a button, our project offers real trading mechanics and user interaction with trading without risk. Users will be able to open trades for free every 12 hours on three instruments. For successful trades, they will receive conditional +100 points, and for unsuccessful ones, -70 points. These points will then be converted into presale tokens.

Presale tokens will be used to trade options on popular pairs of meme tokens on TON, which cannot be shorted on DEX for technical reasons. Our coin will not be a dummy, as it will be supported by the platform and in constant circulation. Further development and the addition of new features on the platform are planned.

The beta version of the application is available at the link: [Telegram: Contact @ton4you\_bot](http://t.me/ton4you_bot/app)

We will also have a squad system to increase user engagement: points will be awarded depending on the number of participants in the squad, as well as contests for the best trader of the week and other events. Users will be able to trade without investments and check their market forecasts daily.

Real trading of instruments for TON is already available. Bets are limited to 1 TON per position until the end of the presale and airdrop program.

I have been trading in the market since 2011 and have experience working with various brokers and instruments. I understand what users need from the platform: good spreads, quality execution of conditions, and interesting instruments. At the moment, there are no quality and simple options on TON, so I intend to correct this situation. The project is designed for the long term.

I am considering proposals for cooperation and advertising.

# [\[TIP-13\] Enhancing Network Security and Validator Accountability in TON Blockchain Through Slashing Mechanisms](/t/tip-13-enhancing-network-security-and-validator-accountability-in-ton-blockchain-through-slashing-mechanisms/259)

**Abstract**

The Open Nework (TON) Blockchain introduces an innovative slashing mechanism aimed at enhancing network security and maintaining validator accountability. This article delves into the technicalities of this mechanism, focusing on the detection, complaint, and penalization processes for idle validators. Developed by igroman787, the mechanism is integrated into the `mytonctrl` tool, facilitating the automatic generation of complaints against underperforming validators and the subsequent voting process.

**Introduction**

The TON Blockchain operates with a dynamic set of validators responsible for processing transactions and creating blocks. Ensuring the active participation of these validators is crucial for the network’s integrity and performance. To address this, the TON community has implemented a slashing mechanism, which penalizes validators failing to fulfill their duties.

**Implementation Details**

The slashing process begins after the validation period, where validators audit each other’s performance based on the number of processed blocks. Validators using `mytonctrl` can automatically generate and vote on complaints against idle validators, employing a variety of TON tools and scripts.

**Testing and Validation**

Initially, to encourage participation and allow for the testing of the new mechanism, the penalty was set at a nominal value of 101 coins. This approach ensures validators are not discouraged during the initial phase, while still promoting active engagement and responsibility.

**Technical Overview**

The process involves several steps, starting from the validation of validator performance, complaint generation, and ending with the voting on these complaints. Key technical aspects include:

1.  **Performance Check**: Validators assess each other’s contribution using `lite-client` commands, focusing on the blocks created within a specific timeframe.
2.  **Complaint Generation**: If a validator’s performance is found lacking, and no existing complaint is present, a new complaint is generated using `fift` scripts and `validator-engine-console` commands.
3.  **Voting on Complaints**: Valid complaints are then subject to voting by the other validators. A validator can vote on a complaint if they haven’t already voted against the accused validator within the same validation period.

**Results and Future Work**

The implementation of this slashing mechanism is a step forward in enhancing the TON Blockchain’s security and efficiency. Early tests indicate a positive impact on validator engagement and network performance. Future work will focus on refining the penalty system to ensure it effectively deters malicious or negligent behavior without discouraging participation.

**Conclusion**

The introduction of a slashing mechanism within the TON Blockchain represents a significant advancement in maintaining a secure and efficient network. By holding validators accountable and incentivizing active participation, TON continues to develop as a robust and trustworthy blockchain platform.

# [Rebalancer – first index token on TON](/t/rebalancer-first-index-token-on-ton/25928)

[The Open League](/c/the-open-league/56) 

    

[Rebalancer](https://tonresear.ch/u/Rebalancer)  June 25, 2024, 3:17pm  1

Token name:  
REBA

Project name:  
Rebalancer

Rebalancing and profitability in liquidity pools ![:chart_with_upwards_trend:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/chart_with_upwards_trend.png?v=12 ":chart_with_upwards_trend:")  
The main idea of our project is that we create many pools with our REBA token, and rebalancing takes place between them through a special mechanism

REBA Contract: EQBYk9Rp8jgFmxE6XIIOiPJSxObAwt6DdThRdTP7t3JQhcTz

Rebalancing is when the price of one asset changes in pools relative to another, and then it is leveled by selling in one pool and buying in another

For each such transaction, commissions go to pools, so they grow in volume and in the amount of liquidity

Now we have 51 pools, we plan to create 100 poods in the next 3-6 months, that is, by the end of 2024

The rebalancing mechanism itself does not allow the price to rise or fall sharply. With any large sale or purchase, a rebalance occurs: a purchase in one pool is followed by a purchase in others and a sale in the first, the price is leveled. This is what can be seen in the history of operations, you can see under the chart:

[Chart](https://www.geckoterminal.com/ton/pools/EQC3gzpEjAal6VSFVBh1oQMgkj4sCd9MCZBxDawMFz2qR-_O)

After each purchase or sale, there is a rebalancing, that is, a counter purchase or sale with our other pools

Now we are entering into new partnerships, increasing liquidity, and bringing our idea to the TON community.

New projects are already coming to us to conclude cooperation, that is, to create a pool with us, and we do not take everything.

our channel: [Telegram: Contact @rebalancer\_ton](https://t.me/rebalancer_ton)

our chat: [Telegram: Contact @rebalancerton\_chat](https://t.me/rebalancerton_chat)

our site: [https://rebalancer.pro/](https://rebalancer.pro/)

X: [x.com](https://twitter.com/REBALANCER_TON)

Now we did x500 from start, we started silently

Also, one of the important stages of the growth of our project will be the rebalancing of volumes in the liquidity pools. For example, in one pool, the token increased relative to REBA, and in the second it fell in price. We manually rebalance the volume in the pools, thereby ensuring the build-up of funds in the pools in the long term

There is also a burning clause in the roadmap: at various events, we plan to burn REBA, reducing its supply.

Thanks for support!

# [\[TIP-14\] Enhancing Blockchain Security: A Technical Examination of Slashing Mechanisms for Cheating Validators in TON](/t/tip-14-enhancing-blockchain-security-a-technical-examination-of-slashing-mechanisms-for-cheating-validators-in-ton/260)

[TON Blockchain](/c/ton-blockchain/build-node/21)  [TON Node](/c/ton-blockchain/build-node/21) 

[tep](https://tonresear.ch/tag/tep)

    

[satoshi](https://tonresear.ch/u/satoshi)  February 5, 2024, 7:32am  1

The integrity of blockchain consensus mechanisms is paramount for network security and trust. In the TON (The Open Network) blockchain, the Block Consensus Protocol operates in conjunction with the Catchain protocol, a foundation for ensuring validators’ adherence to protocol rules. This technical examination delves into the mechanisms TON employs to identify and penalize cheating validators, specifically through the lens of the Catchain protocol as detailed in the “catchcain.pdf” whitepaper and its implementation available at the Newton Blockchain GitHub repository.

#### [](#catchain-protocol-overview-1)Catchain Protocol Overview

Catchain serves as the underlying protocol for block consensus in TON, designed to detect and address cheating validators efficiently. It operates on a premise where each validator’s message in the catchain is cryptographically signed, ensuring authenticity and accountability.

#### [](#mechanism-for-detecting-cheating-validators-2)Mechanism for Detecting Cheating Validators

According to Section 2.7 of the catchcain documentation, cheating is identified when a validator creates two or more divergent versions of the same message, effectively causing a fork. This act is detectable due to the unique signature each message carries, per Section 2.5.4, making the presence of multiple versions of the same signed message irrefutable evidence of misconduct.

#### [](#processing-and-penalizing-cheating-validators-3)Processing and Penalizing Cheating Validators

Upon detection of a fork, the protocol initiates a series of steps to isolate and penalize the cheating validator:

1.  **Fork Detection**: Another validator, upon discovering divergent messages from a single source, ceases to acknowledge any further messages from the offending validator.
2.  **Isolation**: The cheater’s subsequent messages are ignored and not propagated, effectively removing them from the consensus process.
3.  **Penalization**: Currently, cheating validators are penalized in the same manner as idle validators, with potential discussions on imposing harsher penalties for cheating behaviors.

#### [](#future-considerations-4)Future Considerations

The existing mechanism equates the penalization of cheating validators to that of idle validators. However, the proposal for future enhancements includes the introduction of more severe penalties for cheating, necessitating the provision of fork proof to a smart contract. Such an approach, while not immediately necessary, could further bolster network security by discouraging dishonest behavior among validators.

#### [](#conclusion-5)Conclusion

TON’s approach to maintaining consensus integrity through the Catchain protocol offers a robust framework for identifying and penalizing cheating validators. By ensuring that validators adhere to the protocol rules under the threat of detection and penalization, TON enhances its network security, providing a stable and trustworthy platform for users and developers alike. Future enhancements may include more stringent penalties for cheaters, further reinforcing the network’s resilience against fraudulent activities.

This examination underscores the importance of continuous improvement in blockchain security mechanisms and the role of rigorous protocol enforcement in sustaining the trust and reliability of decentralized networks.

# [\[TIP-2\] Navigating the Hard Fork Process in TON Blockchain: A Technical Exploration](/t/tip-2-navigating-the-hard-fork-process-in-ton-blockchain-a-technical-exploration/261)

In the dynamic landscape of blockchain technology, ensuring the robustness and resilience of a network against unforeseen vulnerabilities is paramount. This document delves into the intricate process of conducting a hard fork within the TON Blockchain framework, a necessary maneuver to mitigate fatal network shutdowns triggered by bugs or vulnerabilities. Our discussion spans both the technical and organizational facets required to seamlessly coordinate a network reboot.

#### [](#hard-fork-mechanism-overview-1)Hard Fork Mechanism Overview

A hard fork, or a rollback action, is initiated to rectify critical network issues without compromising the integrity and continuity of the blockchain. This process involves generating a new block through a `create-hardfork` operation, which incorporates a configuration update, specifically targeting ConfigParam34 to redefine the validator set. This ensures the network’s validation process continues unhindered with a refreshed validator roster.

#### [](#technical-workflow-2)Technical Workflow

1.  **Validator Set Update**: A new validator set is established by generating a config query with an updated ConfigParam34 via `update-config.fif`. This list must be comprehensive enough to sustain the hardforked configuration, initially incorporating at least one validator.
    
2.  **Block Generation**: A new block is generated, predating the latest block by a minimum of one hundred blocks, using the `create-hardfork` utility. This step is critical for ensuring the network’s capacity to incorporate the hardfork without disrupting its operational continuity.
    
3.  **Configuration and Validation**:
    
    *   The generated hardfork block is integrated into the `global.config.json` under the hardfork section.
    *   Validators are restarted with the new configuration, with a validation commencement check following shortly after.
4.  **Stabilization and Connectivity**: Post-validation, efforts to stabilize the network and establish connectivity between nodes are undertaken. Challenges such as the ‘inited\_next\_left’ error and issues related to state serialization and node synchronization are addressed through technical adjustments and strategic planning.
    

#### [](#research-questions-and-next-steps-3)Research Questions and Next Steps

Our ongoing research seeks to resolve key questions, including the causative factors behind specific errors post-hardfork and the optimal strategies for network configuration adjustments during the hardfork process without exclusive reliance on the config master key. Further, considerations on the validator set composition and potential utility of additional parameters in the hardfork creation process are under exploration.

#### [](#conclusion-4)Conclusion

The hard fork process within the TON Blockchain represents a sophisticated technical endeavor, necessitating a deep understanding of both the blockchain’s architecture and the procedural nuances involved in executing such a critical operation. As we continue to refine our approach and address the outlined research questions, our goal remains to enhance the resilience and efficiency of the TON Blockchain, ensuring its robust defense against vulnerabilities and its continued evolution in the blockchain ecosystem.

TONG possesses a unique economic model, with 30% of its supply used for IDO on the TonUP platform and the other 30% allocated to form LPs, all of which have been destroyed. This means that during the issuance process of $TONG, there was no pre-allocation by the fair launch team - a full 100%. Moreover, since all LPs have been eliminated, it effectively prevents any possibility of rugpull.

**40% of liquidity reward part are sent to STON’s wallet.**

> # What is TONMinutes?
> 
> We are a team of 2 who are active in the hypercasual scene. Due to our work, we of course monitor the development of the game industry very carefully. Each and every one of us is also interested in the blockchain and its possibilities, so that we have come across Play2Earn games from time to time. Of course only for research reasons, as it should be for reasonable developers, we of course played some of these games.
> 
> We noticed that many of the games were more basic games with no frills, just existing concepts that were relatively heartlessly adapted to the blockchain, with the purpose of pushing a game token that was just as simple deployed to the market as the game itself was. At this point, I’m sure that some games have already crossed your mind. Yes, it’s exactly that game we’re gossiping about right now.
> 
> Of course there are also pieces of jewelry, my personal favorite is “Gods Unchained”. The game is far from finished and still has its quirks, but as a Hearthstone fan from the very beginning, I’ve had a lot of fun. Angry tongues will blur that it is only a copy of a well-known game deployed on the blockchain. I just say, yes, right, but it was done well and is just fun! Collecting is satisfying thanks to the combination of NFT creation with different material levels, which cannot be said of other trading card games. At this point, hats off “Gods Unchained”.
> 
> Of course we came across other giants like “Axie Infinity” along the way. Axie is really very smart, the idea of ​​NFTs is used very well here. That made a lot of people to put on their own versions of the same system, but let’s stay with Axie.
> 
> Breeding is fun and is associated with a certain tension, of course a certain tactic is also required here. In my opinion, the game itself is not the best. A huge community has formed around it, with scholarships and everything, but it is rather monotonous. The guys are still doing it right, as the entry of Samsung Next proves.
> 
> In all the games we encountered, one thing particularly bothered us, either the investment was much too high or it just took an incredibly long time to collect a few pennies. Play2Earn sounds more like a promise that has not been kept. In the games where you can really make money, like Axie Infinity, entry is simply not possible for many players.
> 
> This is where we come into play. We wanted to solve the problem of long monotonous playing times just for a rather small return and the problem of high entry costs in order to actually be able to earn money.
> 
> TONMinutes was born!
> 
> # What is the TONMinutes Game Series?
> 
> TONMinutes is not a single game, but a series of games in which the aim is to achieve the high score within 10 minutes. But let’s start from the beginning:
> 
> First of all, the player must have mint a ticket to participate in a game session.
> 
> The price is $ 45, which is the average price you would pay for a new game. Of course, we also distribute tickets through competitions or giveaways, about which you can find out more in the upcoming posts.
> 
> Once the Game Starts, you have 24 hours to start your own game session and set a high score within 10 minutes. We will reveal the game shortly before the start of each session. Most of the time, it will be an endless games that is hardly more difficult than Flappy Bird. You can restart as often as you like in your 10 minutes and break your own high score. The highest rating is entered in the leaderboard together with your wallet address and your ticket ID. Based on your position on the leaderboard, you will receive a profit that will differ from session to session.
> 
> Pretty simple, right?
> 
> # Rewards
> 
> Let’s take the example of the first session, in which a maximum of 10,000 players can participate. As said, the ticket will cost around 45 USD, whereby we will use TON as the currency, as we will bring our Tickets out on The Open Network. We use TON, because the gas fees are particularly low here, so that you actually come to just under 45 USD and the price does not double, as it would be the case on Ethereum Mainnet.

[The Open League](/c/the-open-league/token-leaderboard/57)  [Token Battle](/c/the-open-league/token-leaderboard/57) 

    

[Rebalancer](https://tonresear.ch/u/Rebalancer)   June 28, 2024, 7:13pm  1

Token name:  
REBA

Project name:  
Rebalancer

Rebalancing and profitability in liquidity pools ![:chart_with_upwards_trend:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/chart_with_upwards_trend.png?v=12 ":chart_with_upwards_trend:")  
The main idea of our project is that we create many pools with our REBA token, and rebalancing takes place between them through a special mechanism

REBA Contract: EQBYk9Rp8jgFmxE6XIIOiPJSxObAwt6DdThRdTP7t3JQhcTz

Rebalancing is when the price of one asset changes in pools relative to another, and then it is leveled by selling in one pool and buying in another

For each such transaction, commissions go to pools, so they grow in volume and in the amount of liquidity

Now we have 51 pools, we plan to create 100 poods in the next 3-6 months, that is, by the end of 2024

The rebalancing mechanism itself does not allow the price to rise or fall sharply. With any large sale or purchase, a rebalance occurs: a purchase in one pool is followed by a purchase in others and a sale in the first, the price is leveled. This is what can be seen in the history of operations, you can see under the chart:

[Chart](https://www.geckoterminal.com/ton/pools/EQC3gzpEjAal6VSFVBh1oQMgkj4sCd9MCZBxDawMFz2qR-_O)

After each purchase or sale, there is a rebalancing, that is, a counter purchase or sale with our other pools

Now we are entering into new partnerships, increasing liquidity, and bringing our idea to the TON community.

New projects are already coming to us to conclude cooperation, that is, to create a pool with us, and we do not take everything.

our channel: [Telegram: Contact @rebalancer\_ton](https://t.me/rebalancer_ton)

our chat: [Telegram: Contact @rebalancerton\_chat](https://t.me/rebalancerton_chat)

our site: [https://rebalancer.pro/](https://rebalancer.pro/)

X: [x.com](https://twitter.com/REBALANCER_TON)

Now we did x500 from start, we started silently

Also, one of the important stages of the growth of our project will be the rebalancing of volumes in the liquidity pools. For example, in one pool, the token increased relative to REBA, and in the second it fell in price. We manually rebalance the volume in the pools, thereby ensuring the build-up of funds in the pools in the long term

There is also a burning clause in the roadmap: at various events, we plan to burn REBA, reducing its supply.

Thanks for support!

This time, the people at Ton Base proposed the Jetton Revolution ([https://t.me/tonbase/476](https://t.me/tonbase/476)): redesigning the PoW Giver contract, with tokens to be named in $GRAM.

GPU mining ([https://github.com/TrueCarry/JettonGramGpuMiner](https://github.com/TrueCarry/JettonGramGpuMiner)) is crucial in this context.

Many issues arise during mining, and discussions have already started at Ton Research. Miners interested in these developments are welcome to join.

> We are a team of two people actively working in the hyper-casual games genre. We carefully monitor the development of the gaming industry and, of course, are interested in blockchain and its capabilities. The idea of ​​creating Play2Earn games has long attracted our attention, and after studying many similar projects, we noticed that many of them are basic games with minimal adaptations to the blockchain, created only to promote the game token.
> 
> Our goal is to create something truly fun and useful for players.
> 
> TONMinutes game series  
> TONMinutes is not just one game, but a series of games where the goal is to score the maximum number of points in 10 minutes. It all starts with the fact that the player must receive a ticket to participate in the gaming session.
> 
> The ticket price is $45, which is about the average price for a new game. We will also be giving away tickets through competitions and giveaways, which you can learn about in future posts.
> 
> Once the game starts, you will have 24 hours to start your gaming session and achieve a high score within 10 minutes. We will reveal the game shortly before the start of each session. In most cases, these will be endless games, no more complex than Flappy Bird. You can restart the game as many times as you like within 10 minutes and improve your score. The highest score will be listed on the leaderboard along with your wallet and ticket ID. Based on your position on the leaderboard, you will receive rewards that will vary from session to session.

Every chain has signature meme coins and I think $MAN is going to be at the forefront of Ton just as the character has been at the forefront of telegram since 2014.

TON Magic provides native **Telegram integration** by patching the official Telegram Web app

When turned on, it patches the official Telegram web app ([Telegram](http://web.telegram.org/a)) by adding Send Toncoins button in private conversations to the message attachment menu.  
![image](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b12efe3f87a16fef5385d458d9124786c13a5cfa.png)

When clicked, a special service message is sent to a user requesting his TON wallet address. Given the recipient uses Telegram web app and has TON Wallet Plugin installed with TON Magic feature activated, a response service message will be sent back, allowing to immediately transfer coins.

我撰寫了一個 Highload Wallet 的腳本，大家有興趣的話可以根據 README 的指示自己運行一次。首先，需要先部署自己的 Highload Wallet v3，接著就可以試試看轉 TON 給自己的 Wallet v4、轉 Jetton（需要先將 Jetton 轉給 Highload Wallet）或是嘗試 send batch messages。如果有任何問題，歡迎隨時找我討論。

Pretty cool utility for this token . The most coolest thing that is people can see their rewards instantly and they are pretty big tbh . Unfortunately, most of the people are getting involved in mini-apps that won’t give them anything or 0.2 USD and they waist their time .  
To sum up . I think this token and mini-app really need your attention:) Rewards will be bigger from season to season of game .

$SPOTTY will be the mascot of Telegram Open Network as it was for VK, Telegram. It has the best narrative on TON.

Even $REDO is a Spotty, but with a hood. But at the moment of writing our MCap is 50 times less, so we have a huge room to grow.

I sincerely support $SPOTTY and its community. Honestly I think it’s the best community I’ve ever been in.

$SPOTTY isn’t just a meme, it’s the symbol and the mascot.

WAGMI, Spotties

[Angelskii](https://tonresear.ch/u/Angelskii)  July 2, 2024, 11:25am  1

**Реальное рабочее производство** токенизируются и позволяет холдерам их монеты выбирать дизайн одежды и получать до 30% профита с продаж

**Microdiving Coin** ( $MIC ) — напрямую связана с реальной тканью. 1 $MIC = 1 метр ткани.

Производство уже подготовило 1 километр разных тканей для использования в блокчейне.

Холдеры могут активно участвовать в процессе создания дизайна одежды через специальный чат, а в будущем и через тг бота.

**Холдеры будут получать до 30% кэшбэка с маржи** по товарам, дизайн которых был создан при их участии. Также доход будет идти от бонусных программ.

Это не скам. Я общался с владельцем и узнавал все детали. Он публичный, можете сами спросить у него дополнительные вопросы — @Andril10

**Прямо сейчас идет фаирлаунч NFT** и вы можете инвестировать в производство на запуске по самой выгодной цене [Ton Raffles](https://tonraffles.app/nft/launchpad/EQC46W25gnrdrK9Y4ueC2McP2DwAsA3oe-yXp36OjGVJ6vBO/UQAl17oY5sIWnRFB75K7NYBkpQCzxxRw6vHe70o7QZiat0Lr)

Все подтверждающие фото и видео вы можете посмотреть на официальном телеграм канале проекта — @microdiving

**Я крайне рекомендую поддержать ребят, помочь в их смелой идеи, ну и в будущем заработать конечно.**

How ![:fuelpump:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/fuelpump.png?v=12 ":fuelpump:") GasPump works:

1.  Any user can create a token for **0.3 TON** in less than **2 minutes**. All that’s needed are: an image, a name, and a $TICKER.
    
2.  Token **instantly** becomes tradable using a bonding curve algorithm (the earlier you buy – the lower the price, the later you buy – the higher the price). The token creator has **the right to the first purchase** at the lowest price. This is their **only (!)** privilege compared to other buyers. If the token you created is not bought by anyone, you can always sell it and get back all the invested TON (excluding a small fee).
    
3.  When the token’s market capitalization reaches ~$20K (equivalent to gathering 1000 TON), all the collected liquidity is **automatically** sent to DeDust to reach new heights. LP tokens are **burned**.
    

The token creator cannot **scam** or **rug-pull** you because the entire process is transparent and governed by bullet-proof smart contracts. ![:fuelpump:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/fuelpump.png?v=12 ":fuelpump:") GasPump is the **only way** to fairly and safely launch a TON token.

And the cherry ![:cherries:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/cherries.png?v=12 ":cherries:") on top: after creating or buying the token, you receive an automatically generated **sticker pack** with the token’s image for easy shilling!
