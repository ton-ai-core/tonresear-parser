*   **Token Name**: NOVA
    
*   **Project’s Twitter**: [@dragunovaton](https://x.com/dragunovaton)
    
*   **Please describe your project and token utility**:  
    [Dragunova Trading Bot](https://t.me/dragunovaton) is a fast, secure trading bot built directly into Telegram. The project was born and raised in the Telegram and TON ecosystems, catering to crypto traders, built by crypto traders. Modeled after the sharpshooter precision of the Dragunov sniper rifle, NOVA is your expert in executing market moves with unparalleled accuracy and speed. We’ve recently gone live with our own private node in order to provide the fastest possible trading on the TON Blockchain. The development team is currently working on a list of new features to ship to users including, but not limited to; limit orders, sniping, Gaspump/Wonton integration and revenue sharing. NOVA token holders will be entitled to 40% of all trading fees generated by the bot. While not a token utility specifically, it’s worth noting that users can also receive an additional 30% of trading fees from referred users via our Referral System.
    
*   **Please provide detailed information on your token distribution, especially indicating the % of token supply held by the team and the status of the team’s LP tokens:**  
    The NOVA token contract is revoked and the initial LP has been recently re-locked. Community members have contributed to our token liquidity, particularly around our recent promotion with [ston.fi](http://ston.fi) which included boosted rewards for participants [https://t.me/stonfidex/624](https://t.me/stonfidex/624)  
    We did not conduct a presale, ICO or anything of that nature. NOVA was a stealth launch without advertisement and the community has organically bought and holds about 65% of the supply. [23% was burned after launch](https://tonviewer.com/EQCPIijcaVHuuaPLtuCtiD0mwueZG73beHJ5vdV_l9_vzv5_?section=holders), with 10% set aside for marketing and future liquidity provisions, of which [6.965% remains](https://tonviewer.com/UQClzmpo21bKwgdlzRKVxVcrI_IBg6XWXz1sJkD_gt3UNUYu) and [4.2% currently rests in the ston.fi pool](https://tonviewer.com/EQCPIijcaVHuuaPLtuCtiD0mwueZG73beHJ5vdV_l9_vzv5_?section=holders).
    
*   **CA**: EQCPIijcaVHuuaPLtuCtiD0mwueZG73beHJ5vdV\_l9\_vzv5\_
    
*   **LP**: EQAQ\_iIhPd6eTJYOq6KrqZEksp85WYc7sQM6d0jgX0xOqtrA
    
*   **Please describe your project roadmap for the next 6-12 months:**  
    As mentioned above, our development team is currently working to ship the community’s most sought-after features in the safest and most secure manner possible. While our intention is to provide the fastest trade execution on the TON Blockchain, our highest priority has been, and always will be, safety and security. Bot features most likely to be rolled out to Dragunova users in the next 6-12 months include limit orders, new launch sniping, liquidity listening, Gaspump/Wonton integration and revenue sharing. To help achieve our goals, we are currently working to expand our development team from 4 (1 full-time and 3 part-time) devs to 10 (3 full-time and 7+ part-time). Additionally, as broader TON Ecosystem attention rises we will begin to put our [~3000 TON Treasury](https://tonviewer.com/UQBoknzDD3eqq-vVm09G38VjMp0PM-an5XMFLhU4R5vMXELI) to work on marketing and partnerships.

We got access to the collection wallet and managed to regain some part of the community. Also we managed to keep the floor price from going down to zero. We are going to give a new life to this project and release a p2e platform based on TG miniapps, including farming bot and different games with PvE and PvP modes. Also we are going to have an utilitary token that will be used to access our games. It can be gained only VIA our farming bot. The main gateway to our ecosystem is our farming bot paired with our NFT collection, that provides boosted token gain.  
    \-Farming bot is already in development stage.

# [Revolutionizing Community Funding on TON Blockchain: The Meridian Initiative](/t/revolutionizing-community-funding-on-ton-blockchain-the-meridian-initiative/325)

[Application](/c/application/20) 

    

[Simpson](https://tonresear.ch/u/Simpson)   February 8, 2024, 5:48am  1

**Abstract:** The Meridian initiative marks a groundbreaking advancement in the TON Blockchain ecosystem, establishing the first entirely on-chain collection of random characters, Meridian. This initiative not only showcases a technical marvel but also pioneers a community-driven approach to fund innovative projects within the TON ecosystem. Unlike traditional NFT collections, Meridian focuses on building a robust community, the Meridian Club, dedicated to supporting and financing projects on TON, emphasizing collective decision-making and direct involvement in the ecosystem’s growth.

**Introduction:** The advent of blockchain technology has ushered in a new era of decentralized finance and community-driven project funding. Among various platforms, the TON Blockchain stands out for its scalability, speed, and efficiency. Leveraging these attributes, the Meridian initiative introduces a novel concept of community engagement and funding. Through the sale of unique, on-chain generated characters, Meridian directs a significant portion of its revenue towards community-controlled treasury, empowering holders to fund promising projects on the TON network.

**Meridian Overview:**

*   **Unique Attributes:** Each Meridian character is generated entirely on-chain, ensuring 100% randomness and uniqueness. The collection boasts a no off-chain pre-sales and pre-minting policy, with all operations governed by smart contracts.
*   **Revenue Allocation:** A significant 50% of sales and re-sales revenue is allocated to the Meridian Club’s treasury, facilitating collective investment decisions.
*   **Auction Mechanics:** Meridian introduces a daily auction system, where new characters are minted and offered, starting at a minimum bid of 1 TON.

**Meridian Club Manifesto:**  
The Meridian Club is more than a collection of NFT holders; it’s a movement. Adhering to a manifesto that champions the support of early-stage projects, the club aims to foster a culture of collaboration, support, and angel investment skills development. This manifesto underlines the community’s commitment to being at the forefront of funding experimental ideas and projects within the TON ecosystem, setting a new standard for community engagement and support.

**Technical Innovation: On-Chain Artwork:**  
Meridian sets itself apart by storing all artwork directly on the TON Blockchain, a feat achieved through custom lossless binary compression designed for pixel-art graphics. This approach ensures that Meridian characters are permanently accessible as long as the TON network exists, bypassing the need for external storage solutions like IPFS.

**Meridian Characters Composition:**

*   **Components:** Meridian characters are composed of multiple elements, including 21 backgrounds, 4 bodies, 6 eyes, 102 heads, and 47 labels, culminating in over 2.4 million unique combinations.
*   **Equality in Rarity:** All Meridians are crafted to be equally rare, promoting fairness and inclusivity within the collection.

**Governance and Future Directions:**  
The governance structure of the Meridian Club is designed to evolve, starting with a unique approach where a “Tyrant” leads the community in its initial phases. This interim governance model is intended to foster culture and prepare for democratic governance through elections.

**Conclusion:**  
The Meridian initiative on the TON Blockchain represents a significant leap forward in community-driven funding and governance. By blending technical innovation with a strong focus on community values and participation, Meridian paves the way for a new paradigm in supporting and realizing the potential of projects within the TON ecosystem.

# [Chocolate Coin 🍫 - The Open League App (Season 6)](/t/chocolate-coin-the-open-league-app-season-6/32644)

[The Open League](/c/the-open-league/app-leaderboard/58)  [App League](/c/the-open-league/app-leaderboard/58) 

    

[Alex\_Creator](https://tonresear.ch/u/Alex_Creator)   September 8, 2024, 8:10pm  1

**Chocolate Coin** ![:chocolate_bar:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/chocolate_bar.png?v=12 ":chocolate_bar:")![:gem:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/gem.png?v=12 ":gem:")![:cake:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/cake.png?v=12 ":cake:")

Chocolate Coin is primarily a congratulatory token.

Utility and main essence - to bring benefit in the form of congratulations.

**Spiritual component - “thank you”, “I thank you”, “congratulate”**.

> We are talking about a socially useful token ![:recycle:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/recycle.png?v=12 ":recycle:") with 2 types of utility… and 3 types of monetization

.

The advantages are a relatively easy launch and, in theory, mass adoption + monetization within the application.

**At least every person faces such a situation 2 times a year. On average, from 15 to 60 times with situations where it is useful per year**.

Wrapped in an idea/method - “**to give chocolate**”.

In the real world, this is used through: “to give a chocolate bar ![:chocolate_bar:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/chocolate_bar.png?v=12 ":chocolate_bar:")/a box of chocolates” or “to congratulate with a cake ![:birthday:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/birthday.png?v=12 ":birthday:")![:cake:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/cake.png?v=12 ":cake:")/champagne​:champagne:”

Here the idea is the same, to replace the real tradition with congratulations with crypto.

A token through which you can express gratitude to other people.

To thank for the work done, the service rendered, the assistance provided.

Congratulate on a birthday, graduation, the end of an event, successful completion or receipt of something (documents, exam), promotion or your own way to say thank you to a person, friend, relative, acquaintance.

The additional essence of the idea is “hold the chocolate”.

After all, the simplest way to materially congratulate a person in the physical world is to give him a chocolate bar.

My idea is a gratitude token - Chocolate. ![:chocolate_bar:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/chocolate_bar.png?v=12 ":chocolate_bar:")

In other words, you can give a gift / thank a person through it.

It will be quite applicable to send this cryptocurrency to someone through the \*send function in the general chat.

Imagine a general chat of colleagues and one of the employees has a holiday (birthday, gave birth to a child, got a license, passed an exam, received a diploma).

The token will have an application. A person logs in and sees.

A chart of chocolate bars by country. Conventionally, EU countries (Germany, France), the CIS, and Japan, for example.

That is, he sees three columns of different colors and prices in USD and CHOCOLATE next to them.

He can also choose to be shown the average price in a certain country

Or even better, the average price of a box of chocolates or a cake.

Inspiration from the McMenu Index (when you can easily determine the level of a country’s economy by going to a Mac and ordering ![:fries:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/fries.png?v=12 ":fries:")![:hamburger:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/hamburger.png?v=12 ":hamburger:")). Here’s a similar index you can make for chocolate. This is the “cool” component of the token (marketing).

The application will also have beautiful congratulatory pictures for downloading.

**Monetization** - through the sale of the token itself, a 3% swap tax (like clowns through a smart contract) for team development.

_And a special section and sale of discount/service vouchers from partners_. **Let’s say tours from tour operators or (I know you said it on AMA, we used to own a STO) sale of a discount (voucher) for diagnostics at a partner STO (this is for example, in fact, there could be IT courses, foreign language courses).**

That is, the real applicability and development of the project will consist of collaborations with projects and sales through the CHOCOLATE bot of their services or goods.

For monetization, you can release an NFE collection, where there will be discounts on partner services. Like a promo code or discount card for the purchase of conditional advertising in the partner’s channel (conditionally 15% on an advertising post) and other activities, bonuses and privileges.

In other words, marketing and marketplace.

# [TON-Jetton And ETH-Token's main difference?](/t/ton-jetton-and-eth-tokens-main-difference/33)

[Application](/c/application/jetton/26)  [Jetton](/c/application/jetton/26) 

    

[Sno](https://tonresear.ch/u/Sno)  January 15, 2024, 3:30am  1

What differentiates Jetton on TON from the token system on ETH? What functionalities does Jetton have that ETH tokens do not possess?  
Specifically, what are the primary differences between Jetton on TON and the token system on ETH at present?

 

[doge](https://tonresear.ch/u/doge) January 18, 2024, 6:41am  2

The Jetton standard on TON (The Open Network) and the token system on Ethereum (ETH) represent two different approaches to token implementation in blockchain ecosystems. Let’s discuss the primary differences between them:

1.  **Smart Contract Architecture**:
    
    *   **TON Jettons**: Each Jetton in TON is associated with a master smart contract and individual smart contracts for each owner, known as “jetton-wallets”. This distributed architecture means that each user’s balance is managed by a separate smart contract.
    *   **Ethereum Tokens**: In Ethereum, typically, all balances of a specific token are managed by a single smart contract. Each token adhering to standards like ERC-20 has its own contract, which tracks the balances of all users.
2.  **Transfer Mechanism**:
    
    *   **TON Jettons**: The transfer of Jettons involves a process where the sender’s jetton-wallet contract sends a message to the receiver’s jetton-wallet contract to update balances. This includes handling of `forward_payload`, allowing for additional data or messages to be sent along with the transfer.
    *   **Ethereum Tokens**: Transfers are usually simpler, with the ERC-20 standard providing a `transfer` function that updates the balances within the contract. There’s no inherent mechanism for additional data with the transfer (though it can be implemented in various ways).
3.  **Custom Payloads and Forwarding Toncoins**:
    
    *   **TON Jettons**: Offers the capability to include custom payloads and forward Toncoins (the native currency of TON) alongside jetton transfers. This feature enables more complex interactions and use-cases within a single transaction.
    *   **Ethereum Tokens**: While Ethereum smart contracts are highly versatile, the standard token transfer methods (like ERC-20) do not natively support additional custom payloads or forwarding native ETH in the standard transfer method.
4.  **Decentralized Balance Management**:
    
    *   **TON Jettons**: Each jetton-wallet contract independently manages the balance of jettons for a user, providing a more decentralized approach to balance management.
    *   **Ethereum Tokens**: Balance management is centralized within the token’s smart contract.
5.  **Burn Mechanism**:
    
    *   **TON Jettons**: Includes a specific mechanism for burning jettons, which is an integral part of the standard. This allows for reducing the supply of tokens in a controlled manner.
    *   **Ethereum Tokens**: Burning tokens is typically achieved by sending them to a known burn address, but it’s not a standardized part of the ERC-20 protocol.
6.  **On-chain Balance Inquiry**:
    
    *   **TON Jettons**: The standard mentions a drawback related to querying actual wallet balances on-chain, as balances might change by the time the query is processed.
    *   **Ethereum Tokens**: Balance inquiries are straightforward and reflect the state at the time of the latest block.
7.  **Future Development**:
    
    *   **TON Jettons**: The documentation hints at future developments like external message tokens, indicating an evolving standard.
    *   **Ethereum Tokens**: Ethereum’s token standards are also evolving, but changes and new features typically come in the form of new standards (like ERC-721 for NFTs, ERC-1155 for multi-token standards, etc.).

Feature

TON Jettons

Ethereum Tokens

**Smart Contract Structure**

Each Jetton has a master contract and individual jetton-wallet contracts for each owner.

A single smart contract manages all token balances.

**Transfer Mechanism**

Transfer involves sender and receiver jetton-wallet contracts interacting.

Uses a `transfer` function in the contract to update balances.

**Custom Payloads and Forwarding Currency**

Supports custom payloads and forwarding of Toncoins alongside jettons.

No native support for additional data or forwarding ETH in standard transfers.

**Decentralized Balance Management**

Balance is managed by individual jetton-wallet contracts.

Balance management is centralized within the token’s contract.

**Burn Mechanism**

Specific burn mechanism as part of the standard.

Typically involves sending to a burn address, not standardized in ERC-20.

**On-chain Balance Inquiry**

Challenges in querying actual on-chain balances due to potential changes.

Direct and current balance inquiries based on the latest block.

**Flexibility and Use-cases**

Allows for complex interactions in a single transaction with more flexibility.

Highly versatile but less flexibility in standard token transfers.

**Future Development and Evolution**

Indicates potential future developments like external message tokens.

Evolves through new standards (e.g., ERC-721, ERC-1155).

**Adoption and Ecosystem**

Still evolving and gaining adoption.

Widely adopted with a vast ecosystem of applications.

In summary, the Jetton standard on TON introduces a more decentralized approach to token balance management and offers features like custom payloads and forwarding of native currency alongside token transfers, which are not inherent in Ethereum’s token standards like ERC-20. However, Ethereum’s token system benefits from simplicity and widespread adoption in the blockchain ecosystem.

# [Implementing Minimal ADNL Client-Server in Rust for TON Blockchain](/t/implementing-minimal-adnl-client-server-in-rust-for-ton-blockchain/359)

[Application](/c/application/20) 

    

[ASURADA](https://tonresear.ch/u/ASURADA)   February 14, 2024, 9:20am  1

## [](#adnl-implementation-status-1)ADNL Implementation Status

The current implementation status of the ADNL features is summarized in the table below:

Feature

Status

ADNL Client

![:white_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:") Implemented

![:white_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:") Implemented

ed25519 libs

curve25519\_dalek + x25519\_dalek

## [](#quickstart-guide-2)Quickstart Guide

To get started with the ADNL client implementation in Rust, you can run the following example:

```
cargo run --example time
```

Below is a brief explanation of the Rust code for the ADNL client:

```
use adnl::AdnlClient;
use anyhow::{anyhow, Context, Result};
use std::net::SocketAddrV4;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Decode the liteserver public key
    let remote_public: [u8; 32] = base64::decode("JhXt7H1dZTgxQTIyGiYV4f9VUARuDxFl/1kVBjLSMB8=")
        .context("Error decode base64")?
        .try_into().map_err(|_| anyhow!("Bad public key length"))?;

    let ls_ip = "65.21.74.140";
    let ls_port = 46427;

    // Create an AdnlClient instance
    let mut client =
        AdnlClient::connect(remote_public, SocketAddrV4::new(ls_ip.parse()?, ls_port)).await?;

    // Prepare a serialized TL query for getting the time
    let mut query = hex::decode("7af98bb435263e6c95d6fecb497dfd0aa5f031e7d412986b5ce720496db512052e8f2d100cdf068c7904345aad16000000000000")?;

    // Send the query over ADNL using a random nonce
    client.send(&mut query).await?;

    // Receive the result into a vector with an 8192 bytes buffer
    let mut result = Vec::<u8>::new();
    client.receive(&mut result).await?;

    // Extract the time from the serialized TL answer
    println!(
        "received: {}",
        u32::from_le_bytes(result[result.len() - 7..result.len() - 3].try_into()?)
    );
    Ok(())
}
```

This example demonstrates how to connect to a TON liteserver using the ADNL client, send a query to get the current time, and receive the response. The use of `async` ensures that the operations are performed asynchronously, providing efficient network communication.

For further information and updates, you can refer to the [crates.io package](https://crates.io/crates/adnl) and the [documentation](https://docs.rs/adnl).

# [Analyzing the Implementation and Functionality of the Liquid Staking Pool in TON Blockchain](/t/analyzing-the-implementation-and-functionality-of-the-liquid-staking-pool-in-ton-blockchain/36)

[TON Blockchain](/c/ton-blockchain/build-node/21)  [TON Node](/c/ton-blockchain/build-node/21) 

[lst](https://tonresear.ch/tag/lst), [nominator](https://tonresear.ch/tag/nominator)

    

[kingsman](https://tonresear.ch/u/kingsman)  January 23, 2024, 1:43pm  1

The TON blockchain has introduced an innovative protocol known as the Liquid Staking (LSt) pool, which serves to connect TON holders, referred to as Nominators, with hardware node operators for participation in blockchain validation through asset pooling. This protocol not only facilitates the pooling of assets but also integrates with DeFi protocols by issuing Pool Jettons, representing a share of the pool and accruing validation rewards. Understanding the technical details, operational mechanisms, and potential implications of this Liquid Staking pool is crucial for stakeholders in the TON ecosystem.

This inquiry seeks to delve into the technicalities and functionalities of the Liquid Staking pool in the TON blockchain, focusing on several key aspects:

1.  **Protocol Mechanics and Structure**: How does the Liquid Staking protocol function, specifically in terms of connecting TON holders with node operators, and what are the mechanisms for asset pooling and validation participation?
2.  **Role and Functionality of Pool Jettons**: What is the role of Pool Jettons in this protocol, particularly in relation to representing pool shares, interacting with DeFi protocols, and accruing validation rewards?
3.  **Integration with Node Operators**: How do node operators interact with the Liquid Staking pool, especially in using the pooled funds for validation stakes and sharing validation rewards?
4.  **Technical Implementation and Code Deployment**: Can you detail the steps and requirements for cloning the repository, installing dependencies, building contracts, and running tests as outlined in the documentation?
5.  **Terms and Schemes of Operation**: What are the key terms (such as elector, controller, validator, nominator, and jettons) used in the protocol, and how do they contribute to the overall scheme of the Liquid Staking pool?
6.  **Deposit and Withdrawal Mechanisms**: How are deposits and withdrawals managed within the pool, especially considering the role of Pool Jettons and TON ratio updates?
7.  **Governance and Role Management**: What roles (such as Halter, Sudoer, Approver, Interest Manager, and Governor) are defined within the protocol, and how do these roles contribute to the governance and operational management of the pool?
8.  **Optimistic Deposits and Withdrawals**: How are deposits and withdrawals processed in the ‘optimistic mode,’ and what are the implications of this mode for the protocol’s efficiency and security?

This analysis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Liquid Staking pool in the TON blockchain, exploring its technical implementation, operational processes, and potential impact on the TON ecosystem and broader blockchain validation practices.

_Все операции проходят через проверенных провайдеров, чьей инфраструктурой пользуются терминалы и даже банки.  
Мы гарантируем на 100%, что вашему номеру телефона ничего не угрожает при использовании нашего сервиса._

**Пополнение мобильных операторов доступно для:**  
Россия:

*   Билайн
*   Мегафон
*   МТС
*   Т2 (Теле 2)
*   Yota
*   и другие операторы мобильной связи.
*   (На днях добавим Тинькофф.Мобайл и Сбер.Мобайл)

Грузия:

*   Magti
*   Silknet
*   Cellfie

В целом будет больше +100 стран для пополнения и 300+ мобильных провайдеров.

Оплата с Tonkeeper, Wallet, Binance и TON Space.

**Наши преимущества:**

*   На данный момент это самое выгодное пополнение мобильных операторов криптой, с минимальной комиссией.  
    Для России это первое подобное решение, которого еще нет на рынке.
*   Решение позволяет пополнять счет на выбранную вами сумму от 10 до 5000 рублей, на примере России.
*   Скорость обработки транзакции до 10 секунд через CEX (Wallet Telegram и Binance). DEX по-прежнему работает медленно из-за проверок AML — до 10 минут.

Пишите какие мобильные операторы нам добавить, в зависимости от запросов будем добавлять. Спасибо за внимание.

# [Youhold — next adobtion система вознаграждающая за уровень активности в TON и стартапах | Партнерства](/t/youhold-next-adobtion-ton/36305)

[Русский](/c/ru/49) 

    

[SashaJozwiak](https://tonresear.ch/u/SashaJozwiak)   September 11, 2024, 6:24pm  1

Всем привет, я [Sasha](https://t.me/zwiak) из [Youhold](https://t.me/youhold) \[[RU](https://t.me/youhold_ru)\]. Ищу для партнерств начинающие мини-приложения с открытыми лицами и уверенными планами. Первые такие 2-3 стартапа добавлю в YouHold раздел стартапов, вообще без условий (если сами захотите, тоже напишите пост о партнерстве), пока мы маленькие.

**О нас:**

[![youhold](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/f/9/f9014e08a80f9eb1648cb84f1b326011b1094a3e_2_690x386.jpeg)

[Youhold](https://t.me/youhold) определяет есть ли у вас на балансе токены/пулы/фермы из списка, а так же участвуете ли в других стартап-майнилках/играх/кликерах (позже будут добавлены) из списка, и определяет суммарную скорость добычи наших токенов.

Если у вас пока нет активов, вы все равно можете запустить добычу на бонусах, которые зарабатываются внутри мини-приложения.

С 12.09.2024 начинается разработка второго инструмента: игра, подобных которой не было и нет в телеграме. Разработка займет 1-2мес., доступ в бета-тест получат активные пользователи с достаточными балансами, участие таких ранних пользователей будет вознаграждено. Игра будет в самом мини-приложении, у неё есть своя отдельная дорожная карта с переходом в он-чейн. С развитием проекта сложность добычи наших токенов будет возрастать.

[Application](/c/application/20) 

    

[SashaJozwiak](https://tonresear.ch/u/SashaJozwiak)   September 11, 2024, 6:31pm  1

Hello everyone, I’m [Sasha](https://t.me/zwiak) from [Youhold](https://t.me/youhold) \[[RU](https://t.me/youhold_ru)\]. I’m looking for partnerships with start-up mini-apps with open faces and confident plans. I’ll add the first 2-3 such startups to the YouHold startups section, without any conditions (if you want, you can also write a post about the partnership), while we’re small.

**About us:**

[![youhold](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/7/9/79826a569c50065966469fef84ac18143304d7b9_2_690x387.jpeg)

[Youhold](https://t.me/youhold) determines whether you have any tokens/pools/farms from the list on your balance, as well as whether you participate in other startup miners/games/clickers (will be added later) from the list, and determines the total speed of mining our tokens.

If you do not have any assets yet, you can still start mining on bonuses that are earned inside the mini-application.

[![main roadmap youhold](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/a/6/a6a151231d8543875c7708649706745ed55fd3d6_2_272x500.jpeg)

From 12.09.2024, the development of the second tool begins: a game that has never been and is not available in Telegram. The development will take 1-2 months, active users with sufficient balances will get access to the beta test, the participation of such early users will be rewarded. The game will be in the mini-application itself, it has its own separate roadmap with a transition to on-chain. As the project develops, the complexity of mining our tokens will increase.

— Each house has 100 floors with increasing difficulty and chances to get a card, there is a boss on every 10th floor, after each boss the progress is saved, and the collected assets are transferred to the permanent balance;  
— you cannot return to the stage earlier than the previous save or reset the passage, if you get stuck, save up UH for bottles and then take into account your previous experience, read the chat, there are tips and screenshots / videos of other participants;  
— each next house is more difficult by ~ 1%;  
— you can choose a hero to complete the house only on floor 0 at the very beginning of each house;  
— 10 gray cards of one character in your deck turn into 1 bronze card of this character, 10 bronze into 1 silver, 10 silver into 1 gold;  
— any cards increase the airdrop relative to their grade and quantity;  
— for a gold card you can buy a city on the world map, and later get an NFT confirming ownership with the possibility of resale;  
— cards of different grades accordingly reduce fees for UH transfers in chat, see the profile section in the app;

We move forward according to the roadmap (it is here in the first post and in the app itself).

TON Cats is a Telegram social meme token that connects 800 million Telegram users in various ways and attracts more people to the TON ecosystem

TON Cats has many ideas to bring people together. These ideas don’t promise a roadmap, but you can see the spirit of reviving the TON ecosystem

**TON CATS Memtoken ($CATS):**

TON Cats Meme Token is a social meme token on the TON blockchain that allows anyone to participate in the TON Cats ecosystem. This is a cat token that was created solely to take advantage of the TON ecosystem and considers various ways to activate the TON blockchain.

**CATAO (TON Cats Community DAO):**

In the TON Cats ecosystem, the main role is played by the Community, which will form the DAO of the TON Cats ecosystem. The strength of the community will be the ability to control the development of the TON Cats ecosystem through voting. Each member of the cat community who owns the TON CATS memtoken will be able to vote with their tokens, with 1 token equal to 1 vote.

**Generative PFP collection of TON Cats:**

Who loves cats? Everyone loves cats! For our community we will make 6666 magnificent NFT Cats, reflecting all the diversity, cohesion, and strength of the TON Community!

**TON Cats Game:**

The symbiosis of the world’s best messenger Telegram and the TON blockchain allows you to create great mini games right in our favorite messenger! TON Cats will implement all the available functionality of Telegram to diversify the leisure time of our community. The game will be based on Tamagotchi mechanics. In the TON Cats Game you can shelter a furry pet, buy him food, clothes, various decorations and build a magnificent home for him! To do this you will need a lot of love, imagination, and a little TON CATS token.

Ton Cats is going to make games, so it is not only a fantastic meme coin but also a game pad and will attract much more attention and users.  
In the early stages, what is the one factor that most influences a crypto project’s success?

Is it a fairly-distributed token, excellent utility, or visionary founders?

Well, if you were to ask me, I’d tell you it’s a ‘cultish’ community.

The thesis is simple - crypto markets essentially run on attention-driven speculation.

However, in an information-rich world, there is no scarcer commodity than attention. This means that projects have to continuously innovate when it comes to capturing that attention.

Projects that manage to retain this captured attention for the longest time end up creating what we like to call a die-hard or indeed cultish community.

Apart from Ton Cat obvious effect on maintaining positive sentiment toward the project, a loyal community helps founders take a shortcut towards building out the one thing early-stage startups need the most - a distribution network.

An efficient distribution network compounds the amount of attention flowing into your project, which in turn compounds the capital flowing in, which in turn compounds the size of its community and so on.

In the early stages, this is a positive flywheel that’s arguably more impactful than the quality or technical efficiency of the underlying product itself.

# [Optimizing Smart Contract Functionality for Internal Message Forwarding in TON Blockchain 🚀](/t/optimizing-smart-contract-functionality-for-internal-message-forwarding-in-ton-blockchain/366)

[Application](/c/application/20) 

    

[Vegeta](https://tonresear.ch/u/Vegeta)   February 15, 2024, 8:55am  1

**Introduction**

In the realm of TON Blockchain (The Open Network), smart contracts play a pivotal role in enhancing the efficiency and security of transactions. One such innovative smart contract is the **Ton Proxy Contract**, designed to forward internal messages seamlessly. This post delves into the technicalities of this contract, its data cell scheme, and its practical applications, particularly in managing Jetton deposits.

* * *

**Ton Proxy Contract Overview**

The Ton Proxy Contract is engineered to forward internal messages by sending the body refs of incoming internal messages as internal messages with a specific mode (128+32). This mode ensures the forwarding of all TONs from the balance and triggers self-destruction of the contract. For the contract to accept an incoming internal message, the message must contain an initialization segment.

* * *

**Contract Data Cell Scheme**

The data structure of the Ton Proxy Contract is encapsulated in the following scheme:

```
data owner:MsgAddressInt subwallet_id:uint32 = Data;
```

* * *

**Use Cases**

**Jetton Deposits Control**

The Ton Proxy Contract finds its utility in managing Jetton deposits. By employing a single wallet, users can create multiple Jetton deposits. For each Jetton wallet, a proxy contract is instantiated with the Jetton wallet as its owner. Consequently, managing multiple Jetton wallets becomes streamlined by sending messages to their respective proxy contracts.

* * *

**Technical Implementation**

The core functionality of receiving and forwarding internal messages is encapsulated in the following code snippet:

```
int equal_slices (slice a, slice b) asm "SDEQ";

() recv_internal (int balance, int msg_value, cell in_msg_full, slice in_msg_body) {
    slice cs = in_msg_full.begin_parse();
    int flags = cs~load_uint(4);
    if (flags & 1) { ;; ignore all bounced messages
        return ();
    }
    slice sender_address = cs~load_msg_addr();
    slice ds = get_data().begin_parse();
    slice owner_address = ds~load_msg_addr();
    throw_unless(403, equal_slices(sender_address, owner_address));
    while (in_msg_body.slice_refs()) {
        send_raw_message(in_msg_body~load_ref(), 160);
    }
}
```

* * *

**Conclusion**

The Ton Proxy Contract exemplifies the innovative approaches in TON Blockchain to enhance transaction efficiency and security. By enabling streamlined management of Jetton deposits and forwarding internal messages, this smart contract paves the way for more sophisticated blockchain solutions.

Author: Crypto Miner Pro  
Date: February 11, 2024

In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency mining, the TON Blockchain (The Open Network) has garnered significant attention with its native currency, GRAM. Presently, two mining pools are predominantly used for mining GRAM: the official [pool.gramcoin.org](http://pool.gramcoin.org) with 0% commission and the unofficial [ton.ninja](http://ton.ninja) with a 50% commission.

Given the divergence of opinions in various chat forums, possibly due to measurements taken at different times and with different equipment, a live comparison of the profitability of the two pools was conducted. The results are presented in this technical forum post, aimed at providing a detailed and professional insight into the mining yields of GRAM on the TON Blockchain.

### [](#methodology-1)Methodology

1.  **Rental of Identical Hardware**: Two identical RTX 4090 graphics cards were rented from the same location (RO) through the service [vast.ai](http://vast.ai/) ([referral link](https://cloud.vast.ai/?ref_id=109346)).

### [](#observations-2)Observations

*   The yields align with the stated commission rates and current profitability.
*   The TonNinja pool updates the balance less frequently, likely due to data refresh every 15 minutes.
*   The [gramcoin.org](http://gramcoin.org) pool provided almost instantaneous updates, refreshing data after each found share.

### [](#conclusion-3)Conclusion

The comparison reveals a significant difference in mining yields between the official and unofficial pools, with the official [pool.gramcoin.org](http://pool.gramcoin.org) offering a notably higher return due to its 0% commission. This analysis serves as a valuable resource for miners looking to optimize their GRAM mining operations on the TON Blockchain.

# [Simplifying TON Blockchain Validation: Introducing the Single Nominator Smart Contract](/t/simplifying-ton-blockchain-validation-introducing-the-single-nominator-smart-contract/369)

[TON Blockchain](/c/ton-blockchain/build-node/21)  [TON Node](/c/ton-blockchain/build-node/21) 

[nominator](https://tonresear.ch/tag/nominator)

    

[Einstein](https://tonresear.ch/u/Einstein)   February 15, 2024, 11:54am  1

Ensuring the security of the TON blockchain is crucial for its smooth operation. A key player in this process is the validator, responsible for verifying transactions and creating new blocks. However, the traditional approach of using a hot wallet for validation poses security risks, as it is vulnerable to hacking. To address this, we present the Single Nominator smart contract, a secure and simplified solution for validators.

## [](#the-single-nominator-advantage-1)![:shield:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/shield.png?v=12 ":shield:") The Single Nominator Advantage

The Single Nominator smart contract is a streamlined alternative to the Nominator Pool smart contract, supporting only one nominator. This reduction in complexity significantly lowers the attack surface, enhancing security. It is designed for TON validators with sufficient stake to validate independently, offering a more secure option compared to using a hot wallet or an unmaintained restricted wallet.

**Official Code Hash for Verification:**

```
pCrmnqx2/+DkUtPU8T04ehTkbAGlqtul/B2JPmxx9bo=
```

Verify this hash on [TON Verifier](https://verifier.ton.org) before sending funds to a live contract.

## [](#architecture-overview-2)![:building_construction:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/building_construction.png?v=12 ":building_construction:") Architecture Overview

The Single Nominator smart contract mirrors the architecture of the Nominator Pool contract, with a clear separation of roles:

*   **Owner:** A cold wallet holding the staking funds, acting as the single nominator.
*   **Validator:** A wallet on the validator node, capable of signing blocks but unable to access the staking funds.

The workflow involves the owner depositing funds into the Single Nominator contract, which are then used by the validator to enter election cycles. The contract ensures that only the owner can withdraw the funds, providing a secure validation process.

[![Single Nominator Architecture](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/1X/698761b320c01af59ba1bc530ba6ad81551e836e_2_690x209.png)

](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/original/1X/698761b320c01af59ba1bc530ba6ad81551e836e.png "Single Nominator Architecture")

## [](#mitigating-attack-vectors-3)![:shield:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/shield.png?v=12 ":shield:") Mitigating Attack Vectors

The Single Nominator contract addresses several potential attack vectors:

*   **Hot Wallet Security:** The validator’s hot wallet is protected from theft, as it cannot access the staking funds.
*   **Validator Compromise:** In case of a compromised validator wallet, the owner can change the validator address, preventing further unauthorized interactions.
*   **Gas Drainage Attacks:** The contract separates the principal staking funds from the gas fees, preventing attackers from draining the principal.
*   **Emergency Safeguards:** The owner can send raw messages or change the contract code in emergency situations to recover stakes or address unforeseen issues.

## [](#comparison-of-existing-alternatives-4)![:bar_chart:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/bar_chart.png?v=12 ":bar_chart:") Comparison of Existing Alternatives

For validators with enough stake, the Single Nominator contract offers a secure and simplified alternative compared to other setups like hot wallets, restricted wallets, or the Nominator Pool. It provides a streamlined solution with fewer attack vectors and enhanced security features.

## [](#getting-started-with-single-nominator-5)![:rocket:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/rocket.png?v=12 ":rocket:") Getting Started with Single Nominator

To use the Single Nominator contract, you can deploy it using the provided [open-source client](https://github.com/orbs-network/single-nominator-client). The contract integrates seamlessly with MyTonCtrl, allowing for easy management of validation cycles.

For detailed deployment instructions and owner-only operations, please refer to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/orbs-network/single-nominator).

## [](#security-audits-6)![:hammer_and_wrench:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/hammer_and_wrench.png?v=12 ":hammer_and_wrench:") Security Audits

The Single Nominator contract has undergone a thorough security audit by Certik, ensuring its robustness and reliability. The audit report is available in the repository: [Certik Audit](https://github.com/orbs-network/single-nominator/blob/main/certik-audit.pdf).

## [](#conclusion-7)![:memo:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/memo.png?v=12 ":memo:") Conclusion

The Single Nominator smart contract offers a secure and efficient solution for TON validators seeking to reduce their attack surface and simplify their validation process. With its streamlined architecture and robust security features, it stands as the preferred choice for validators with sufficient stake.

С радостью объявляем о новом раунде получателей грантов, одобренных Фондом TON на январь 2024 года.

Эти проекты соответствовали строгим критериям программы грантов, показали инновационные решения и продолжили разрабатывать продукты и инициативы, полезные для пользователей и всей экосистемы TON.

Проект

Описание

**[bemo](https://app.bemo.finance/)**

bemo - первая платформа жидкого стейкинга, построенная на блокчейне TON, которая позволяет стейкать нативные токены TON и взамен получать токены stTON, которые можно свободно использовать в DeFi. Команда разрабатывает мини-приложение в Telegram в рамках гранта, чтобы помочь людям легко стейкать свои монеты TON, не покидая Telegram. Это приложение будет содержать все основные опции стейкинга в одном месте и работать с множеством кошельков TON, включая @wallet, обеспечивая плавный и эффективный онбординг в этот перспективный продукт DeFi. [Присоединяйтесь к сообществу Bemo.](https://t.me/bemofinance)

**[Bounty Bay](https://t.me/bountybay_bot)**

Bounty Bay - это платформа социальной коммерции на базе Web3, которая направлена на расширение возможностей брендов и продавцов с более плавным и эффективным способом привлечения и процветания от социального трафика в Telegram. Платформа внедряет систему монетизированных наград, сосредоточенную на переформатировании общего опыта вирусного распространения продуктов в Telegram; Bounty Bay выступает в качестве новаторской силы, открывая новые возможности в сфере цифровой коммерции. [Присоединяйтесь к сообществу Bounty Bay.](https://t.me/bountybaycommunity)

**[Miomi Game](https://miomi.game/)**

Miomi Game - это электронная спортивная арена для бесплатных и платных турниров и матчей с множеством игр и социальной сетью с возможностями Escrow. Проект может похвастаться преданной аудиторией в 100 тысяч человек, которая сыграла более 1,2 миллиона матчей на оригинальной платформе web2, которую команда теперь преобразует в удобное для пользователя мини-приложение в Telegram. В качестве изюминки: Miomi Game недавно заключила партнерство с известным футбольным звездой Роналдиньо, который будет участвовать в дальнейшем росте проекта.

**[Adsgram](https://adsgram.ai/)**

Adsgram - новая рекламная сет

ь, специально созданная для мини-приложений Telegram. Команда решает текущую острую проблему отсутствия инструментов монетизации рекламы для мини-приложений Telegram. Интересно и важно то, что команда пытается смягчить собственную боль: проект возглавляет сооснователь Fanton, одной из крупнейших игр на TON, которая столкнулась с проблемами монетизации при росте приложения. |

Приглашаем вас принять участие в программе грантов TON в качестве разработчика проекта и участника оценки. **[Узнайте больше о различных аспектах программы грантов TON на официальной странице.](https://ton.org/grants)**

Перевод на русском

Гидра - это первый в своём роде миф-токен отличающийся наиболее прозрачной и честной системой распределения монет.

[![img4_ru](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/f/f18b2ca0042a1cdc8c71813e2cfe01269acead95_2_690x222.png)

Распределение монет происходит исключительно с помощью механизма бустов на DEX биржах.

### [](#h-1)Токеномика

```

- 8 лямов сюды

- Лям туды

- Чуток сюдым

- И капля тут

```

А, вообще, вся циркулирующая эмиссия находится у холдеров. Остальное количество монет заморожены на год с последующим распределением их на десятилетия в пулах ликвидности, [убедитесь сами](https://tonviewer.com/EQD4P32U10snNoIavoq6cYPTQR82ewAjO20epigrWRAup54_?section=holders).

[![img3_ru](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/f/f47afc01395ff5355ff007dd0118b05a8c468e20_2_690x222.png)

Помимо основного пула ликвидности TON/Hydra, жетон Hydra имеет более пятидесяти второстепенных пулов.

50+ пулов ликвидности (клик)

![pools](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4542895cc3456cc5f2229ec27e214423b75568d6.gif)

Данная диверсификация пулов создаёт лёгкий старт для холдеров других монет. Для создания или поддержания наших пулов у них нет необходимости продавать свои активы, они сразу могут задействовать их в пулах ликвидности и обеспечить себе дополнительный доход за счёт хороших бустов.

[![img2_ru](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/e/e713c6475bc28fd1556a4a3dc77091f8137c9bdf_2_690x222.png)

Жетон Hydra позволяет пользователям других монет переждать негативные манипуляции в виде обвала стоимости монет при этом получая вознаграждение в виде стабильного жетона HYDRA. Таким образом Hydra Coin помогает фаундерам других проектов избежать “паник-сейла”.

[![img5_ru](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/62e8aa36d9948d8380bd0291876b44d29ac0f9c7_2_690x222.png)

Hydra Coin надёжный ориентир для новичков в мире мем-токенов. Кроме того, благодаря отсутствию доминирующих крупных держателей (“китов”), которые могли бы существенно влиять на ценовую динамику, $HYDRA обладает относительной стабильностью по сравнению с другими активами, предотвращая резкие колебания стоимости и делая этот жетон более предсказуемым для инвесторов.

币的分配完全通过 DEX 交易所的助推机制完成.

除了主要的 TON/Hydra 流动性池，Hydra 代币还有五十多个二级池.

50 多个流动性池（点击）

![pools](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4542895cc3456cc5f2229ec27e214423b75568d6.gif)

这种资金池的多样化为其他币种的持有者创造了一个轻松的起点。他们不需要出售自己的资产来创建或维护我们的资金池，他们可以立即将这些资产用于流动性资金池，并通过良好的提振为自己提供额外收入。.

[![img2_ch](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/010c2033d223b805dafc48b7ccc90cf6075113a9_2_690x222.png)

九头蛇币允许其他币种的用户等待币值暴跌的负面操纵，同时获得稳定的九头蛇代币。通过这种方式，Hydra Coin 可以帮助其他项目的资助者避免 “恐慌性抛售”。.

[![img5_ch](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/3/30956b7f56c5b24b715d0417193e0659916e9e13_2_690x222.png)

海德拉代币对于刚进入代币世界的新手来说是一个可靠的参考点。此外，由于不存在可显著影响价格动态的占主导地位的大持有者（“鲸鱼”），$HYDRA 与其他资产相比具有相对稳定性，可防止价值剧烈波动，使投资者更容易预测该代币的价格。.

### [](#tokenomics-7)Tokenomics

```
  - 8 mil here
  - Yum to here
  - A little bit here
  - And a drop here.
```

And, in general, all circulating issuance is held by the holders. The rest of the coins are frozen for a year and then distributed for decades in liquidity pools, [see for yourself](https://tonviewer.com/EQD4P32U10snNoIavoq6cYPTQR82ewAjO20epigrWRAup54_?section=holders).

#### [](#in-addition-to-the-main-liquidity-pool-tonhydra-the-hydra-token-has-more-than-fifty-secondary-pools-8)In addition to the main liquidity pool TON/Hydra, the Hydra token has more than fifty secondary pools.

50+ liquidity pools (click)

![pools](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4542895cc3456cc5f2229ec27e214423b75568d6.gif)

This diversification of pools creates an easy start for holders of other coins. They don’t need to sell their assets to create or maintain our pools, they can immediately use them in the liquidity pools and provide themselves with additional income through good boosts.

[![img3_en](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/d/db2ef28ea1e90b16a145f2f91e15fe7869d76b6f_2_690x222.png)

The Hydra jetton allows users of other coins to wait out negative manipulations in the form of collapsing coin values while being rewarded with a stable HYDRA jetton. In this way Hydra Coin helps funders of other projects to avoid the “panic selling”.

[![img5_en](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/c5a94985dce7087d4cd4f85d56c661699073ef18_2_690x222.png)

Hydra Coin is a reliable reference point for newcomers to the world of meme tokens. In addition, due to the absence of dominant large holders (“whales”) that could significantly influence price dynamics, $HYDRA has relative stability compared to other assets, preventing sharp fluctuations

В [The Open Network (TON)](https://ton.org/) наше сообщество является движущей силой всего, что мы делаем. Мы стремимся построить сеть, сформированную людьми и для людей, и ваш вклад имеет решающее значение для успеха TON.

Мы рады представить нашу новую программу добровольцев сообщества: [TON Syndicate](https://ton.org/ambassadors). Мы ищем людей со всего мира, которые разделяют наш энтузиазм по поводу TON, понимают нашу миссию и стремятся помочь нам привлечь к TON более широкую аудиторию. Независимо от вашего прошлого опыта, TON Syndicate приветствует всех, кто искренне интересуется и готов способствовать продвижению TON.

**Ваши задачи как члена Syndicate**

**Организация встреч**

Помогите нам расширить адаптацию, организуя регулярные офлайн-встречи TON, связываясь с местными энтузиастами блокчейна, чтобы рассказать им о TON, создавая думающие центры и проводя открытые дебаты. Организаторы встреч поднимают сетевое взаимодействие на новый уровень, исследуя новые парадигмы социального взаимодействия и обсуждая использование смарт-контрактов, децентрализованных финансов, торговли и коммуникаций.

**Создание контента**

Как создатель контента, вы будете производить контент о TON через видео, блоги, инфографику, подкасты, мемы или любую другую форму творческого производства. Такой контент будет информативным и содержательным.

**Модерация сообщества**

Вы поможете нам модерировать официальные социальные каналы, чтобы сделать пространства TON информативными, продуктивными и приятными местами для встречи сообщества на разных языках и на различных платформах.

**Переводчики**

Расширение локализации [сайта TON](https://ton.org/en), контента и каналов увеличит охват TON для неанглоязычных сообществ, позволяя большему количеству энтузиастов присоединиться к движению.

Присоединяйтесь к движению TON сейчас!

Users train their own AI agents on personal data, which can be fine-tuned by businesses for a commission, providing privacy-focused and relevant AI-derived analytics. The platform aims to create a seamless experience for users and businesses alike, ensuring secure, efficient, and meaningful AI interactions.

## [](#p-62236-web3-advantages-2)Web3 Advantages

Unlike traditional Web2 data brokerage models, Bridge23 leverages decentralized Web3 principles to offer users full control over their personal data. By allowing users to train personal AI agents and have businesses fine-tune them for insights, we create a new, transparent data economy. Users are fairly compensated for their data usage, addressing a major flaw in Web2 data models, where users often don’t receive any value from their shared data.

## [](#p-62236-how-its-built-3)How It’s Built

Bridge23 is built using a modular canister architecture on the Internet Computer, featuring:

*   AI Agent Fine-Tuning modules for both user and business AI agents
*   A real-time exchange rate canister
*   OCR and text recognition canister
*   Cross-chain NFT minting and EVM authentication canisters
*   Separate user canisters to ensure personalized AI training
*   Data transformation (to vector formats) for AI fine-tuning
*   Smart Contract for Payments\*\*: A TON-based smart contract is implemented to handle payments between businesses and users. When businesses use user data for AI fine-tuning, the smart contract automates the process of payments, ensuring secure, transparent, and traceable transactions. Payments are processed using fiat (via Stripe integration) or cryptocurrency, converting interactions with data into tangible earnings for users.

## [](#p-62236-go-to-market-strategy-4)Go-To-Market Strategy

Bridge23 will continue its multi-channel growth strategy, including:

*   Partnering with data-driven businesses to create real-world applications for AI agents
*   Offering incentives like referral programs where users and businesses earn by participating
*   Launching educational initiatives to teach users how to train their AI agents and monetize data
*   0% fee for early adopters to encourage more usage

## [](#p-62236-monetization-5)Monetization

*   Commissions on AI agent fine-tuning between users and businesses
*   Transaction fees on data insights or premium tools for merchants

## [](#p-62236-status-of-the-project-6)Status of the Project

Bridge23 is currently in its MVP stage, with over 5,000 users on the waitlist and more than 1,000 beta 0.10.0 users in TMA.

Hey, TON Community! Today I’d like to tell you how to manage your RPC nodes to get the best performance and the lowest downtimes possible. We will take the GetBlock RPC node provider as an example as they support TON RPC nodes on Mainnet and Testnet. We are gonna learn how they manage their high-speed RPC, and discover some services for node management, handy tools, tips, and tricks

Let’s jump right into it!

#### [](#p-62320-how-getblock-rpc-provider-works-1)How GetBlock - RPC Provider Works

When running an RPC node it’s crucial to be always aware of the consistency and availability of your node. To do so, you have to utilize some robust management and monitoring tools. Here’s an example of the tools GetBlock is using:

*   Prometheus open-source monitoring system
*   Grafana observability platform; (the latter sources data from the first one.)
*   The health sidecar
*   Alertmanager service in Slack
*   Loadservice
*   Auto-switching system

Prometheus gathers metrics and databases to display in Grafana. Prometheus is also bonded to Alertmanager service to inform the team in Slack about all events regarding infrastructure status. The health sidecar helps GetBlock monitor the current height and health of the nodes. To get immediate notifications from the monitoring tool GetBlock connected it to the Alertmanager service in Slack. It helps to get the fastest notification if some issue occurs and always double-check when it’s resolved. The health sidecar is also connected to the auto-switching system. So if the block deviation occurs, the unhealthy node is instantly switched to a healthy one. The last but not the least important thing is to keep the node updated to the latest versions. This way GetBlock constantly monitors blockchains’ GitHub repositories and social medias to find out about the upcoming updates first in hand.

All of that helps GetBlock to reach the highest node availability of 99%!

If you don’t wanna experience all the hustles associated with running and maintaining your TON RPC node. You can simply connect to RPC nodes for 50+ blockchains with GetBlock. It’s now even available with 30% OFF for your first shared node subscription.

**TMONK** draws inspiration from Pavel Durov’s vision, aiming to pioneer change within the **TON** ecosystem. **TMONK** is more than just a meme. We aim to become the first project dedicated to crowdfunding and donations on the **TON** network.

**CROWDFUNDING**

At the moment, we are developing a dense network of partnerships and collaborations with numerous projects within the **TON ecosystem**, ranging from meme projects to utility projects. We firmly believe that collaboration among projects, mutual support, and cohesion can only benefit the entire TON ecosystem. We provide all our partners with the opportunity to showcase their projects and to receive assistance for any needs directly from us or from our collaborators within our network (development, marketing, graphics, etc.). The **TON network** is unique because projects do not compete or engage in warfare; instead, they collaborate and cooperate to create something innovative together. For this reason, we have placed our focus entirely on this network.

**CHARITY**

We can make a positive impact in the world beyond the blockchain, thanks to it. We have chosen **TON** and **TELEGRAM** to reach millions of people due to the ease of use, speed, and simplicity of the network. We have already made two donations to **Save The Children**. During the donation process, we noticed the impossibility of using **TON** as a method to make donations. For this reason, we have held several meetings with this foundation to help them implement their service with our beloved **TON network**. We have formed a lifelong partnership with our ambassador, Jeribond.ton, who has worked in the social sector for years and is an influential figure within the **TON ecosystem**.

# [TON Memecoin Working Group Monthly Progress Report](/t/ton-memecoin-working-group-monthly-progress-report/38252)

[TON Memelandia](/c/ton-memelandia/85) 

    

[openleaguesupport](https://tonresear.ch/u/openleaguesupport)  October 11, 2024, 1:53pm  1

**\[September, 2024\]**

**1\. Overview:**

Memecoin Working Groups have made significant strides in September, laying the foundation for major upcoming events and initiatives. The team have focused on expanding the memecoin narrative, engaging the community, and preparing for exciting launches in the coming months.

**2\. Achievements for the Month:**

**Memelandia Working Group - September Highlights**

• **Event Participation:**

TON Memecoin Working Group kicked off September by attending an in-person event in Singapore, where five Memecoins—Redo, Mittens, Durev, TON Fish, and Plane—were showcased. Key builders and supporters attended, with [Ston.Fi](http://Ston.Fi)’s Martin Masser hosting the TON Memelandia Panel. Top KOLs like Jana and Viktor also showed support, while Alena and Vlad delivered a compelling talk on why TON Memecoins are set to be the next big trend.

• **Community Engagement:**

The Working Group ramped up community engagement with weekly discussions and groups on Telegram, creating spaces for Memecoin enthusiasts, builders, and KOLs to collaborate and strategize. This engagement is fueling the excitement for the upcoming TON Takeover!

• **Memelandia League Preparation:**

Significant progress was made toward the launch of the TON Memelandia League, which will feature MemeCoins competing across three realms: Memecoin Mountain, Launchpad Lair, and Cabal Arena. The team has been developing metrics, rewards, and designs for a successful launch.

• **New Reward Systems:**

The group has developed new types of rewards to support Memecoins on TON, covering various verticals such as marketing and more. These rewards are designed to motivate projects and create momentum in the ecosystem.

• **Methodology Overhaul:**

The team completely redesigned the methodology for Meme Mountain contests, making the competition structure more effective and engaging.

• **Backend Development:**

Backend systems were developed for both Cabal Arena and Meme Mountain, laying the groundwork for key upcoming initiatives.

• **Cabal Arena Innovation:**

The Cabal Arena project was conceptualized and its development began, including both the website and backend. This new addition will bring fresh dynamics to the MemeCoin ecosystem.

• **Partnerships and Integrations:**

New partnerships were established with Moni Score, encouraging Memecoin projects to enhance their Twitter presence and engage Western audiences. Additionally, the team held discussions with market makers, info bots, and influencers to promote the upcoming contests.

• **Ecosystem Expansion:**

The team initiated conversations with Bubblemaps and Moonshot to broaden the ecosystem’s capabilities, including the possibility of Apple Pay being used for Memecoin purchases.

**3\. Challenges Faced:**

• **Complex Contest Structures:**

Balancing the complexity of the Memecoin Mountain and Cabal Arena while ensuring user engagement has been a key challenge. However, backend development is progressing well to address these needs.

• **Partnership Integration:**

Finalizing partnerships and integrating them into the ecosystem, especially with new technologies like Apple Pay, requires coordination and time.

**4\. Plans for Next Month:**

• **Memelandia League Launch:**

The highly anticipated launch of the Memelandia League is set for mid-October. MemeCoins will find a permanent home as the competition kicks off, promising exciting battles across the Memelandia realms.

• **Global Expansion:**

After Singapore, Memecoins are heading to Dubai for the TON Gateway event, followed by MEMECON in Bangkok, marking their expansion into the Middle East and Asia.

• **Lore Development and Community Engagement:**

The group will continue to develop the Lore of Memelandia through more Twitter Spaces, inviting founders and OGs to share their inspiring journeys.

• **Contest Launches:**

Both Cabal Arena and Meme Mountain contests will officially launch next month, with an expected total trading volume of around $500 million, which will significantly boost the TON DeFi ecosystem.

• **Developer Experience Enhancement:**

Collaborations with [kapa.ai](http://kapa.ai) and [mintlify.com](http://mintlify.com) are in the works to improve the developer experience for those working with TON documentation.

• **Partnership Follow-Up:**

The team will solidify ongoing conversations and partnerships, including expanding the influencer network and info bot collaborations to maximize the visibility and participation in contests.

# [Introducing TON Restaking: The UTONIC Approach](/t/introducing-ton-restaking-the-utonic-approach/38260)

[Application](/c/application/20) 

    

[UTONIC](https://tonresear.ch/u/UTONIC)  October 12, 2024, 10:45am  1

We plan to implement the UTONIC protocol, which will be the first restaking protocol on the TON network. Similar to how EigenLayer introduced restaking to the Ethereum ecosystem — currently securing 5% of the total ETH supply to protect various applications on Ethereum — UTONIC will bring restaking to the TON ecosystem. This will enhance the security of the growing number of applications on TON, increase the value and yield of TON assets, and encourage more TON holders to participate in staking.

TLDR

*   UTONIC is the first restaking solution on the TON network, modeled after Ethereum’s EigenLayer.
*   Restaking enhances security and scalability by allowing staked assets to secure multiple decentralized applications. It also increases use cases and yields for TON, concentrating value towards the TON token.
*   UTONIC supports both native TON staking pools/nodes and Liquid Staking TON to participate in restaking. The native restaking is based on the Nominator Pool staking.
*   The UTONIC architecture consists of several key components: Stakers, Vaults, Restaking Module, Operators, Actively Validated Services (AVS).
*   UTONIC provides a naive LRT solution, uTON. Users can mint uTON using Native TON or LST and utilize UTONIC’s restaking services.
*   UTONIC Stage 1 \[Pre-restaking\] is going to launch, with TON restaked to provide AVS testnet service before slash modular works.

# [](#p-62404-background-1)Background

Restaking allows staked assets to be used for securing multiple networks or protocols simultaneously. Restaking enables the same tokens to be utilized across multiple layers, increasing the utility and potential returns for token holders. This method also enhances security and decentralization by allowing stakers to support various applications without needing to acquire additional assets.

Restaking was first introduced into the Ethereum ecosystem by EigenLayer, a pioneering restaking project on the Ethereum network. It leverages staked ETH to secure and protect additional dApps and protocols built on Ethereum. As of now, EigenLayer has managed to lock up 5% of the total ETH supply (4.7 million ETH, $12B TVL), supporting more than 17 Actively Validated Services (AVS).

Following the emergence of EigenLayer, restaking has become one of the hottest topics in the industry. Beyond Ethereum, other networks like Solana and BNB Chain have begun developing their own restaking protocols. For instance, Solayer handles restaking on Solana, while BinLayer does so on BNB Chain. Currently, however, there is no restaking protocol available on the TON network.

# [](#p-62404-why-is-ton-restaking-important-2)Why is TON Restaking Important?

The Open Network (TON) is a decentralized and open internet platform focusing on achieving mass adoption while operating in a highly scalable secure framework. TON has now become one of the top ten public blockchains by market capital.

TON restaking is crucial as it enhances the security and scalability of the TON ecosystem by allowing existing staked assets and methods to be used in securing additional decentralized applications and services, where many of them will choose hybrid on-chain and off-chain structure to serve reaching hundreds of millions of users moving forward. This approach leverages the network’s existing validators, creating a more robust, flexible and economically-efficient infrastructure without the need for new resources.

Restaking Benefits:

1.  For TON Ecosystem: The network structure of TON Layer 1 is well-suited for certain applications, but there are also scenarios where it may not be the best fit, like where it needs atomic transactions and synchronicity. In these cases, Layer 2 solutions and Bridges are often required to meet the development and usage needs of such applications. TON Restaking can enhance the security of these Layer 2 solutions and Bridges, thus fostering the growth of the TON ecosystem.
2.  For TON Applications: New applications can build on a robust security foundation provided by TON restaking, thus encouraging innovation and leading to broader adoption within the ecosystem.
3.  For TON Holders: TON will have more use cases, resulting in greater yields for staking. Applications will rely on TON for security rather than issuing new assets, leading to a concentration of value towards the TON token.

# [](#p-62404-staking-methods-3)Staking Methods

Users can participate in TON restaking through several two methods, including Native Restaking and LST Restaking.

## [](#p-62404-native-restaking-based-on-single-nominator-pool-4)Native Restaking: Based on (Single) Nominator Pool

There are currently several ways to participate in TON staking, which can generally be categorized into two types:

1.  Using a Hot Wallet for Staking: This method is less secure because the wallet holding the funds needs to be kept on the validator node, making it vulnerable to hacking.
2.  Using a (Single) Nominator Pool for Staking: This approach allows users to separate the wallet holding the funds from the validator wallet, enabling secure participation in staking.

The (Single) Nominator Pool is an excellent smart contract design that greatly enhances the security of TON staking. More importantly, it is a smart contract that can be further improved, giving us the flexibility to build on it and implement the restaking functionality.

UTONIC smart contracts will delegate the staked TON to the established (Single) Nominator Pool for participation in TON staking, while also opting into the restaking modules built on UTONIC. A key function of the UTONIC smart contracts is to act as the owner, fund provider, and fund withdrawer for the (Single) Nominator Pool. If a staker who has restaked on UTONIC is proven to have behaved adversarially while participating in an AVS, then that staker’s TON will be withdrawn from the Nominator Pool and be slashed according to the on-chain slashing contract of the AVS.

## [](#p-62404-lst-restaking-5)LST Restaking

In addition to supporting native TON tokens for restaking through an upgraded Nominator Pool, we also support LST (Liquid Staking Token) participation in restaking. Our decision to support LST restaking is based on the following considerations:

1.  Established LST protocols have already implemented the core functionalities for participating in Layer 1 staking and distributing staking rewards, ensuring that the LST tokens are backed by a corresponding amount of staked TON assets.
2.  Using LST tokens for restaking has proven to be a viable solution in Ethereum’s restaking ecosystem, with successful implementations seen in projects like EigenLayer and Symbiotic.
3.  Supporting LST participation in restaking prevents the need for TON tokens to be withdrawn from LSTs solely for restaking purposes, thereby improving the whole capital efficiency within the TON ecosystem and offering convenience to TON users.

# [](#p-62404-utonic-architecture-6)UTONIC Architecture

The UTONIC Restaking protocol allows users to restake their Native TON tokens and LST TON tokens by depositing the assets. The users can determine the restaking strategies and delegate the restaked assets to the operators. Operators can then register with Actively Validated Services (AVS) to provide economic security. Operators perform tasks for the AVS in exchange for rewards, and the AVS has the ability to slash the assets that have been delegated if they indulge in malicious behaviour.

There are multiple entities involved in this protocol to enable the restaking of both LST TON and Native TON. The modularity of the protocol also provides an interface to extend restaking to any new asset as well. The architecture should give an overview of how each entity is placed in the system following which we shall go over them in detail.

# [](#p-62404-utonic-smart-contracts-design-7)UTONIC Smart Contracts Design

The main function of the UTONIC contract is to manage the delegation relationship and shares record between users and operators.

Due to the asynchronous and shared nature of TON, designing interactions between contracts is relatively more challenging. To minimize issues with synchronization, we aim to keep contract functions as clear as possible while maintaining platform scalability. The main related contracts include the following:

UTONIC Manager: This contract serves as the central information hub for the platform. It records which assets are supported for restaking and performs management operations, via the Strategy contracts. Additionally, it maintains information about current platform operators and manages tasks such as registration and updating info.

Operator Register: Belongs to UTONIC Manager. Each operator has a contract to record their information and status, such as whether they are registered on the platform and if they have been slashed.

Strategy: Each supported asset corresponds to a Strategy, which is divided into two types: Strategy LST and Strategy TON (only one), corresponding to LST assets and native TON, respectively. The latter additionally includes functionalities related to TON staking. Unlike Eigenlayer, users delegate to independent operators for each Strategy. The main function of the Strategy is to record and maintain the user’s asset shares, as well as to track the total shares delegated by users to the Operator on the other end.

User Strategy Info: Belongs to Strategy. Each (Strategy, User) has one such contract. It records and maintains the user’s corresponding asset shares, which change when the user performs operations such as deposit, withdraw, delegate, and undelegate.

Operator Strategy Share: Belongs to Strategy. Each (Strategy, Operator) has one such contract. It records and maintains the total shares currently delegated to the corresponding operator for an asset. When the user performs operations such as depositing, delegating, and undelegating, the shares change based on the state. A key design point of the UTONIC contract is to ensure the accurate accounting of User Strategy Info and Operator Strategy Share.

## [](#p-62404-user-deposit-into-utonic-10)User: Deposit into UTONIC

Depositing into UTONIC varies depending on whether the Staker is depositing Native TON or LST Tokens. The main difference involves the handling of Jetton.

# [](#p-62404-lrt-liquidity-creates-value-19)LRT: Liquidity Creates Value

Beyond implementing the basic restaking framework, we also support minting Liquid Restaking Tokens. This approach helps to prevent liquidity shortages within the ecosystem that can arise when assets are locked up in staking and restaking.

# [](#p-62404-uton-architecture-20)uTON Architecture

The uTON token is the native embedded liquid restaking token (LRT) of TON in the UTONIC platform. The system built around uTON is called the uTON system. It allows users to restake their Native TON tokens and LST TON tokens with unified management. The assets will first go into some proxy contracts, and then uTON will be minted. After that, the assets move into the vaults.The vaults determine the restaking strategies and delegate the restaked assets to the operators, with the help of the UTONIC restaking system.

The uTON contracts are divided into two parts: one part is the uTON Jetton, which has a standard Jetton interface and extends some capabilities based on demand; the other part consists of a series of Proxy contracts. The Proxy contracts have the authority to mint uTON, with different Proxy contracts implementing the uTON mint/burn process for various scenarios.

Key features:

1.  When Proxy mints uTON, it is valued in TON, and the Proxy internally manages assets, such as LST TON, relative to the price of TON.
2.  uTON Minter manages the uTON price of TON. It can be modified by the admin account.
3.  When users withdraw uTON, they always receive native TON. That is, if users enter with other assets, such as stTON stake, they will withdraw TON too.

# [](#p-62404-pre-restaking-26)Pre-restaking

During the UTONIC Testnet phase, any validators of TON (Single) Nominator Pools currently active on the TON network can join the UTONIC Pre-restaking event. Participation is facilitated through the minting of the UTONIC Operator SBT, a non-transferable NFT that serves as proof of engagement in the UTONIC Pre-restaking program. By minting the UTONIC Operator SBT, validators signal their commitment to participating in the UTONIC Testnet and the future operation of the UTONIC AVS that will be deployed on the UTONIC testnet.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdAKWVy8ea4j78DGNc_WIgLyeP4J9nBDckHQfdyjTyvjVRtCt0rx1-VjOGl41mAR4MNkLlGFdRaBc_48aAf4_jbbcFojwNPFxJ07yyBqF5I93CbX0c6mERxzrb4USQ2Buewx1PmDjld4rO8rySlkX6aOyo?key=7CkgQfx0FRQsaSjKXojqfQ)

Validators successfully minting the UTONIC Operator SBT will mint an equivalent amount of uTON LRT based on the number of TON tokens staked in the validator’s associated (Single) Nominator Pool. During the testnet phase, the uTON tokens will remain locked in the smart contract, dynamically minting or burning based on the ongoing changes in the amount of TON staked by the validators. UTONIC will track the validator addresses that mint the UTONIC Operator SBT and their corresponding (Single) Nominator Pool addresses, with the staked TON contributing to the TVL under UTONIC Pre-restaking protection.

The primary goal of the UTONIC Testnet is to validate the feasibility of the TON Restaking architecture and to refine its functionality. During this testnet phase, the slashing mechanism will not be enabled.

During the Pre-restaking period, holders of TON, stTON, or tsTON can also directly participate by staking their TON, stTON, or tsTON. Upon restaking, they will mint uTON, which will be sent directly to their wallet and can be immediately used by the restaker.

Join us as we work towards building a more secure and robust staking ecosystem for TON!

[kojhliang](https://tonresear.ch/u/kojhliang)  February 19, 2024, 6:34am  1

Author: Kojhliang, head of research at Kenetic Capital

When I was completing a Ton course topic recently, one such question: For Howard Peng’s NFT template contract (i.e. NFT Collection contract — NFT Item contract), add a function to the contract so that each user’s wallet can mint at most three NFTs.

**Method one:**

If it is a blockchain similar to EVM, the simplest method is to add an additional Map<user\_address,mint\_times> to the NFT collection contract to save the number of times each user has mint.

However, this method is not allowed to be implemented in Ton, because it will cause the gas fee to be unpredictable and does not comply with the Ton sharding idea. Ton needs to decompose all objects of variable length into contracts for storage and processing.

**Method Two:**

Split out a user information ( userInfo) contract to store the number of times this user has mint. Then in the NFT collection contract, send a query message to the userInfo contract to query the number of mints, and then decide whether to allow the user to continue minting NFTs based on the current number of mints contained in the message returned by the userInfo contract.

But this method is also not allowed in Ton. Because the messages of the Ton contract are all asynchronous, it is not synchronous like EVM calling other contracts to obtain the status of other contracts. Data consistency cannot be guaranteed using this approach.

For example:

In Ton, contract A sends a message to contract B, and contract B returns the state C1 of contract B to contract A. However, contract A cannot use this state C1 to make subsequent logical judgments, because when contract A receives the message sent back by contract B, state C1 may have changed to state C2! If you make a judgment based on this C1 status at this time, it may have undesirable consequences. For example, according to method two, when the NFT collection contract receives the number of mints returned by the userInfo contract, the number of mints for the current user may actually be three. At this time, if the collection contract still allows users to continue minting new NFTs, it will not meet business requirements.

**According to the principle of data consistency and common solutions, in order to maintain the atomicity of a transaction in the Ton contract, it can only be solved by converting all related contracts with dependent logic into serial processing.**

For example:

Contract A → Contract B (based on state b, deciding whether to change state b and call the next contract C) → Contract C (based on state c, deciding whether to change state c and call the next contract D) → ….

It can be seen that in this process, there is no need to query the status of other contracts like the second method. All the status that needs to be judged is stored and processed in the contract itself.

However, the problem that arises is that if the business logic that the contract wants to implement becomes more complex and more judgment conditions or variable variables (such as maps, arrays, etc.) are required, the more contracts that need to be decomposed. Dealing with the chain of smart contracts becomes more complex.

This is the price Ton pays to achieve complete sharding. The difficulty of developing complex contracts increases almost exponentially. Compared with traditional synchronous code contract design, which may only require a few lines of code, Ton requires a lot of additional message processing, including exception bounced processing and a very long processing chain to achieve it.

**Attached: Two instructions from Ton official:**

For FT contracts, there is no way to get the actual wallet balance on-chain because the wallet balance may not be up to date when the message with the balance arrives.

**Suggested solution:**

The first option: We can consider adding a global state area to the Ton blockchain, whether within the chain or outside the chain, so that developers can safely execute corresponding logic based on the value of this global state. Of course, how to make this global state data conform to the idea of sharding requires more sophisticated design.

The second option: In order to reduce the difficulty and complexity of development for developers, develop more easy-to-use business models and development assistance tools, so that even if developers use the way of asynchronous message processing, they can develop the smart contract as easily as developing synchronous programs. Otherwise, according to the current design of Ton, it is indeed not suitable to develop and implement too complex business logic in the Ton contract.

# [Why Theft Wars is an Idle Game](/t/why-theft-wars-is-an-idle-game/38328)

**Theft Wars: Shadows of TON** is a Web3 idle game built on TON blockchain. It combines idle mechanics with competitive gameplay, where players take risks and make strategic choices. But what makes Theft Wars an idle game? Let’s find out.

## [](#p-62530-what-is-an-idle-game-1)What is an Idle Game?

Idle games, also called incremental games, allow players to make progress with minimal effort. Theft Wars takes this concept and adds blockchain features. You can create a thief using Soul Bound Tokens (SBTs) and stake game tokens. Similar to other idle games, Theft Wars lets you earn rewards even when you’re not actively playing. You mint a thief and stake tokens to get stronger and earn rewards. However, other players can steal your tokens too, so you have to make careful decisions.

## [](#p-62530-gameplay-overview-2)Gameplay Overview

**Theft Wars: Shadows of TON** is more than just an idle game; it is a competitive experience where players take on the role of thieves attempting to steal tokens from others. Players begin by creating a thief as an SBT and staking game tokens.

The main part of the game is **steals**—where players attempt to take tokens from others. To succeed, targets must be chosen wisely. Your thief has skills like **expertise** (offense) and **vigilance** (defense), which determine how effective you are when attacking or defending during a steal. There’s also an element of luck (random) involved, which means even well-planned steals might not always succeed. This makes every steal is a mix of strategy and chance. Thieves can be leveled up by stealing and earning rewards, improving their abilities. Selecting the right target is crucial for success.

### [](#p-62530-stealing-and-taxes-3)Stealing and Taxes

When you steal in Theft Wars, there is a tax applied, which helps keep the game fair and rewards active players. This tax is the one of the reasons why Theft Wars is considered an idle game—it generates passive income for players, allowing them to benefit from others activities without constant involvement. The tax is split between rewarding other players, maintaining the economy, and supporting game development.

### [](#p-62530-leveling-up-through-steals-4)Leveling Up Through Steals

Theft Wars has a **Cumulative Steal Progression** system, which lets you level up by stealing. There is a limit of 32 steals each day to keep things fair. The more you steal, the higher your level gets, making your thief stronger and unlocking new rewards.

## [](#p-62530-theft-wars-more-than-just-a-game-5)Theft Wars: More than Just a Game

Theft Wars isn’t just a game; it’s also an engaging way to learn about blockchain. You can learn about staking tokens, how taxes work in a decentralized system, and how taking smart risks can help you grow. For example, staking tokens can help you earn more rewards, and the tax system helps keep things fair for everyone. Theft Wars makes learning about blockchain easy and fun.

By playing Theft Wars, you can learn about blockchain, DeFi, and staking—all while having fun. It’s a great way for beginners to understand blockchain without feeling overwhelmed.

Dear developers and game owners, if your game is a purely economic model and it is impossible to earn money without investments, then please notify users about this when you first launch the bot, in order to avoid unpleasant situations such as airdrop hamster and x empire. Users are extremely unhappy and a wave of discontent can capsize our boat…![:sunglasses:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/sunglasses.png?v=12 ":sunglasses:")

Over the same time, our admin team has grown from 4 to 12 and we continue to look for qualified and professional moderators. We will continue running paid marketing/ads on [dexscreener.com](http://dexscreener.com) and Telegram, specifically targeting traders outside of TON. We will also be implementing a large contest to reward community members that are engaging the most on X. We’ve assembled a sub-group of some of our largest token holders that are willing to fund larger marketing costs, such as the coveted Golden Ticker on Dexscreener.
10.  **Do you have any partnerships with Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) or influencers?**

The sad meow community is made up of unique people who helped the token grow.We went from 6k mcap to 2.5m ATH and it’s all organic growth.Strong community + first audio token = perfect memecoin.

It’s going to be ironic that it’s called Sadmeow because I’ll be giving a Happymeow once we hit 1Bil Mc. ![:crying_cat_face:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/crying_cat_face.png?v=12 ":crying_cat_face:")

Hi everyone,

I’m currently taking part in TOL SS6 with a Normie Badge and had a few questions about the App League:

1.  Does interacting with the apps daily improve my Normie score?
2.  If not, does that mean I only need to interact with each app once?

I’ve been checking the leaderboard regularly, but my rank doesn’t seem to be improving. Any advice would be appreciated!

Thanks!

Interaction is good. Ton team has hinted this. Keep grinding, and interacting with the apps you trust. Support them all.

It seems this form has been incorrectly filled out

"Question 10: Do you have any partnerships with Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) or influencers?\*\*

1.  No"

The answer is Yes. Kyle Chasse as advisor and Luke Belmar as Influencer

“Guys when we raid, make a comment about Kyle chasse being our advisor, @ him on Twitter, comment on Luke Belmar being in the chat too, @ him in your responses.”

“And you know what happens when we finally get pushed by top tier KOLs and listed on top tier exchanges? Boom.![:boom:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/boom.png?v=12 ":boom:")”

Phase 2 imminent  
$5.1 mil burn ![:white_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:")  
( Already burnt $1.5 mil, so make it $6.6mil, collectively so far )  
Luke Belmars here ![:white_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:")

“LUKE BELMAR IS IN THIS PROJECT FOR THOSE WHO DONT KNOW”

“You need to have long term vision bro, millionaire dev , burning 30% of the supply, Kyle chasse as an advisor , Luke Belmar is on board”

We are paying tribute to the legendary Resistance Girl - official Telegram sticker pack, hooded girl who embraces internet freedoms and fights against censorship. Having fallen in love with this character long before $TON was even a thing, we are not only aiming to make ideas about digital resistance more popular in society, but also to make people think more about their digital freedoms and fight for the better future of the Internet. And, of course, to facilitate the unstoppable growth of the $TON blockchain!

Great Project with huge potential. Their NFTs made huge volume. Their game with great token burning system is in progres - this will make hugeee impact on token price. Friendly community with comunicative mods and thats very important. Two weeks ago I needed answers to a couple of questions and mod dmed me after 5 minutes (guy with a fox on pfp thank you again). Other people in team are very friendly too but he just answered me first and i appreciate that. Summing up their great team with friendly people, cool nft collection and narration made me buy their token ![:slight_smile:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12 ":slight_smile:")

Ton Ship is honestly a fantastic project. I’ve been here since the very beginning, from the NFT days and the fair launch. Despite the recent rough patch for TON, the team keeps pushing forward. Everyone’s eagerly waiting for the game that’s supposed to come out soon. There’s a lot more in the pipeline, so I’m super excited about what the future holds. Fingers crossed for continued development, and I can’t wait to see what other surprises are in store! Best wishes and good luck from your teddy bear!

Hi I have been on TON the past year and there seems to be a big problem with bringing new investors on chain, I believe with Memelandia and the new audio tokens “Sadmeow” you should consider advertising the first season on crypto banter YouTube channel they have a very large audience of real investors and that’s what TON needs. Thanks

9.  \*\*Briefly describe your memecoin’s strategy for growth and community engagement:The TryTON project develops unique mechanics for community growth and engagement with a focus on airdrop games and bonus NFTs that increase interest and stimulate participant activity.  
    Airdrop games and giveaways:  
    TryTON regularly conducts airdrop games, in which users receive random rewards for performing certain actions - for example, purchasing tokens for specified amounts or fulfilling conditions on token holds. Each participation in an airdrop game can earn participants rewards in tokens and NFTs, which are used to further progress in the game or access unique project features.

    Cards and Bonus NFTs:

For example, the NFT CROWN or NFT PresSOL card brings the holder additional gift boxes with the opportunity to win tokens or other valuable items. These cards keep users interested by allowing them to participate in exclusive promotions and giveaways.  
    Game Mechanics:  
    TryTON also utilizes game mechanics to engage users, such as opening boxes that contain random rewards and promotions like the King of the Mountain contest. This competition motivates users to actively participate and helps build up trading volumes. The opportunity to win exclusive rewards incentivizes users to not only stay active on the platform, but also invest in the project tokens.  
    TryTON also provides support and announcements for its community, making it part of the development and scaling of the project, which creates an active and dedicated community.

8.  **Are you applying for the Major League or Minor League?**: Minor
9.  **Briefly describe your memecoin’s strategy for growth and community engagement:**:

**Wassup, TON Founation!**

We are already 6 months old and we have recently encountered difficulties: the market maker who worked with us sold $BALLS inconsistently and collapsed the token exchange rate, because of which we have no way to pass in Memecoin Mountain according to the criteria. \*\*

**Our meme is this:**  
**\- A unique adaptation of an AI bird with eggs for TON (AI memes are hype on Solana right now and imagine the hype of the degens from there when they come with an interest in Memelandia and see BIG BALLS BIRDS);**  
**\- We are the bridge for WEB2 users to WEB3;**  
**\- Together with the community we have made 500+ memes: @bigballsmemes and we have a TikTok, videos from there have garnered a combined 150K+ views - check it out! ([https://linktr.ee/bigballsbirds](https://linktr.ee/bigballsbirds));**  
**\- Russian channel REN TV did a report about our bird ([Telegram: Contact @big\_balls\_birds](https://t.me/big_balls_birds/267));**  
**\- We have a famous NFT collection ([BIG BALLS BIRDS](https://getgems.io/collection/EQAJZy957mjfURxDg0f_8r0wLRaV02tjE6vx6NTGIlOhBVcD)) that will be used as skins in the game!**  
**\- We subscribe to the philosophy that the most important thing for a meme at TON is first and foremost meme-ness, not utility. We have a TMA coming out in early November - Flappy BIrd with the BALLSY mascot, which will attract a lot of new audiences.**

\*\*We survived a bloody summer for memcoins, we are overcoming our struggles now and we ask you to believe in us. The BIG BALLS BIRDS team will be at The TON Gateway on November 1-2 and wants to show that it is possible to be a meme even in difficult times for token capitalization. \*\*

**Stay with BIG BALLS!**

Been sitting in BALLS for a long time, been through all the circles of hell guys and still haven’t given up. I think TON Foundation should pay attention to such projects because if their token fires hard (and there is a good chance it will), it will create the FOMO with a profit that will make people from other blockchains come to TON.

The strongest side of this project is the community. BBB managed to gather under one wing (bird’s wing huh🐦) people, who believe that strong memes are born from good stories. BBB went through the hardest tests, and proved that they can stand and show that even in conditions when everything seems to be going against you, there is still a chance to succeed. And everyone can reach it, but you need the BIG BALLS to make it🦅

Yo, friends. I have been following the project since its very beginning, almost from the first thousand subscribers in the telegram channel. the team deserves respect, they launched the NFT collection very well, collected the presale in a few minutes. yes, the token did not enter the market very successfully. The chart is literally burning red. But despite this, they created a very cool community, introduced many people to each other, who also began to run telegram channels and promote the TON ecosystem in their messages. Despite all the difficulties, the team continues to work and hope that the memes on TON will resurrect and they will be talked about throughout the wonderful world of web3, that TON will become the new solana, and BALLS will become the new BONK… And I’m doing it with them! BIG BALLS BIRDS is about community.

I’ve been working on this project for quite some time now. I started my journey in cryptocurrency relatively recently, and the first project I encountered was $BALLS. Awkwardly, with absolutely no experience, I began to take a keen interest in this project. First, the presale, then various activities, NFTs, quests, game, raids. And now the project has captured my heart. Balls is not only about a close-knit community but also about strong developers who continue to work hard on the project despite all the setbacks along the way, despite other projects around them failing one after another. I believe in this project and I’m proud to be part of this community.

It seems that BBB has been hit by a lot of adversity. Due to a series of accidents, many projects that came out around the same time have already deflated. And BBB was especially unlucky, as a result of illegal actions MM, which is terribly annoying, but surmountable.

I have been with the project from the very beginning, I was happy in moments of success and worried when things were not going well. BBB has a great team. I am surprised how they have kept the audience informed of events all this time, kept their word, explained their actions and wasted time on fools in chats.  
With such an approach, there was no option that BBB would have a weak community. I consider this one of the fundamental factors of success. In the six months of the token’s existence, a super strong community has formed around the bird with eggs, with truly sane, adequate and cool people, sincerely love them.

Initially, the Bird with Eggs was a funny meme, and now it seems to symbolize how strong in spirit you must be in sometimes really difficult times.  
I am with BBB till the end. How many events are behind that could have become fatal, but a bird with eggs will outlive many. And even if the path is difficult and thorny, it will lead to success, you only need just keep going. ![:muscle:t2:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/muscle/2.png?v=12 ":muscle:t2:")

Greetings to all!

I’m just a member of the community, not an early bird.

During this recent period, when the market in general has been very tough for altcoins and meme coins, the project BIG BALLS BIRDS has shown itself to have “really strong eggs.” ![:slight_smile:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12 ":slight_smile:")

Honestly, I’ve seen them establish new partnerships even when everything seemed bleak. BBB kept doing their work: they held several art competitions for the community (I participated and was truly awarded multiple times!), “Memecity” is still going strong, and the project even launched a beta version of their game where you can play using your own skin… NFT!

Promises are being kept.

I don’t wanna see a truly deserving project suffering from obstacles and the last challenge with mm that they come across — it just isn’t fair.

I want to help this project because here, I’ve found not just a strong community but friends; not just an opportunity to earn but a genuinely strong, popular meme that will “bring the heat if it isn’t strangled.”

This could be a powerful comeback story for the entire TON ecosystem. I believe in the team, in the community, and in this project.

# [Evaluating the Impact of Telegram Web3 Grants on TON Ecosystem Growth](/t/evaluating-the-impact-of-telegram-web3-grants-on-ton-ecosystem-growth/39)

[General](/c/general/4) 

    

[kingsman](https://tonresear.ch/u/kingsman)  January 23, 2024, 1:52pm  1

The TON Foundation’s launch of the Telegram Web3 Grants program represents a significant step towards integrating blockchain functionality within Telegram Messenger. This initiative aims to enhance the TON Ecosystem by supporting various stages of project development and fostering connections with venture capital. In light of this development, we invite a detailed analysis and discussion on the potential impacts and implications of this program.

1.  How does the Telegram Web3 Grants program, with its distinct categories (Type A, B, C, D), strategically support the growth of the TON Ecosystem, especially in relation to the integration within Telegram Messenger?
2.  For Type A grants targeting initial deployments or proof of concept applications, what are the expected criteria for evaluation, and how can developers effectively leverage these grants to transition from concept to a viable product?
3.  In the context of Type B grants, which focus on live TON-based projects without Telegram integration, what challenges and opportunities do developers face in integrating their existing projects with Telegram, and how might the grant facilitate this process?
4.  For projects considering migration to TON blockchain (Type C grants), what are the critical factors in evaluating grant amounts, and how do user numbers, transactions, and Total Value Locked (TVL) influence these decisions?
5.  While Type D does not offer venture funding directly, it aims to connect projects with VC funds or TONcoin.Fund. What role does this type of support play in the broader ecosystem, and how can projects best prepare and position themselves to attract venture capital investment?
6.  Looking at the overall structure of the Telegram Web3 Grants program, how might this initiative compare to similar blockchain accelerator programs in terms of effectiveness, scope, and potential for driving innovation in the blockchain space?
7.  Finally, considering TON’s unique positioning through Telegram, how might this symbiotic relationship between a popular messaging platform and a blockchain ecosystem influence the future landscape of blockchain applications, particularly in terms of user adoption and practical use cases?

This discussion seeks to explore the multifaceted implications of the Telegram Web3 Grants program, focusing on its capacity to drive innovation, facilitate integration, and attract investment within the TON Ecosystem. We encourage contributions from blockchain experts, developers, and enthusiasts to provide insights and perspectives on this significant development.

# [Exploring the TON Blockchain: A Deep Dive into HighloadWalletContractV2](/t/exploring-the-ton-blockchain-a-deep-dive-into-highloadwalletcontractv2/391)

[Application](/c/application/20) 

    

[ASURADA](https://tonresear.ch/u/ASURADA)  February 19, 2024, 5:10pm  1

The TON Blockchain (The Open Network) is a fast, secure, and scalable blockchain and network project, designed to handle millions of transactions per second. In this post, we’ll take a closer look at a specific component of the TON ecosystem: the HighloadWalletContractV2. This contract is a crucial element for developers working on high-load applications that require efficient and reliable wallet management.

## [](#highloadwalletcontractv2-an-overview-1)HighloadWalletContractV2: An Overview

The HighloadWalletContractV2 is a sophisticated smart contract designed for managing wallets in high-load scenarios. It is defined in the [HighloadWalletV2.ts](https://github.com/ndatg/ton-highload-wallet-contract/blob/50365e0/src/HighloadWalletV2.ts#L18) file and implements the `Contract` interface.

### [](#key-features-2)Key Features:

*   **Address Management:** The contract provides a read-only `address` property, which holds the wallet’s address.
*   **Initialization Data:** The `init` property contains the contract’s code and data cells, essential for its initialization.
*   **Public Key Access:** The `publicKey` property allows access to the wallet’s public key, a critical component for transaction security.
*   **Wallet and Workchain ID:** The contract includes `walletId` and `workchain` properties for identifying the wallet and its associated workchain.

### [](#core-methods-3)Core Methods:

1.  **createTransfer:** Generates a transfer request with a specified body and query ID.
2.  **getBalance:** Retrieves the current balance of the wallet.
3.  **getProcessed:** Checks the status of a transaction using its query ID.
4.  **getPublicKey:** Obtains the wallet’s public key in string format.
5.  **send:** Submits a signed transfer message to the network.
6.  **sendTransfer:** Signs and sends a transfer request.
7.  **sender:** Creates a sender instance for managing transactions.

### [](#static-methods-4)Static Methods:

*   **create:** Instantiates a new HighloadWalletContractV2 with the given parameters.
*   **generateQueryId:** Produces a unique query ID for transaction tracking.

## [](#utilizing-highloadwalletcontractv2-in-ton-applications-5)Utilizing HighloadWalletContractV2 in TON Applications

The HighloadWalletContractV2 is a powerful tool for developers building applications on the TON Blockchain. Its efficient handling of wallet transactions and management makes it an ideal choice for high-load environments. By leveraging this contract, developers can ensure smooth and secure operations in their TON-based applications.

For a detailed exploration of the HighloadWalletContractV2, including its properties and methods, visit the [official documentation](https://ndatg.github.io/ton-highload-wallet-contract/classes/HighloadWalletContractV2.html).

* * *

In conclusion, the HighloadWalletContractV2 is a testament to the robustness and versatility of the TON Blockchain. Its design caters to the needs of high-load applications, ensuring that developers have the tools they need to build efficient and secure blockchain solutions. As the TON ecosystem continues to evolve, contracts like HighloadWalletContractV2 will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of blockchain technology.

请教下钱包是如何保证交易顺序和唯一性的啊，在eth上是通过nonce来实现的，ton有类似机制吗？

Welcome to PsyDuckGame’s Monthly Recap! Reflecting on October 2024, it’s evident that this month has been filled with thrilling developments and remarkable achievements in the ever-evolving world of PsyDuckGame. From exciting game updates to engaging events and outstanding community milestones, October has truly shone as a memorable month.

Now, let’s take a look back at the October highlights and revisit the moments that made it an unforgettable chapter in the Quack-Quack game!

October - Month of Quack-Quack Feature

In our update, we are thrilled to introduce a new our newest game call Flappy Duck - A tap-to-earn adventure inspired by the iconic Flappy Bird! A fun, addictive challenge where every tap brings you closer to BIG rewards! The higher you soar, the more rewards you’ll earn!

We’re kicking off our newest mining campaign, and it’s a game-changer! Get ready to mine all the Feathers until we LIST our assets!

Partnership Announcements

This month has been monumental for PsyDuck as we successfully connected with six exceptional partners, each bringing unique value to our community and game development. These collabs have led to more than 18 task exchanges and have rewarded our community with millions of feathers. These partnerships are set to elevate the Quack-Quack experience and provide our players with unparalleled opportunities and enhancements.

What’s next?

We’ve got big plans to expand PsyDuck beyond just a game—it’s all about evolving into a full-fledged ecosystem on the TON blockchain. We’re looking at adding new mini-games, enhanced PvP features, and even more ways for players to earn rewards.

Plus, our ultimate goal is to become a major publisher on TON, which means you can expect even bigger collaborations, community-driven content, and more innovative ways to engage. We’re just getting started, and the best is yet to come!

## [](#p-64818-tonxjs-adapter-simplified-migration-from-other-ton-sdkston-apis-4)TONX.js Adapter: Simplified Migration from Other TON SDKs/TON APIs

The new TONX.js Adapter allows for an easy transition from popular TON client libraries like [@ton/ton](https://github.com/ton-org/ton), [TonWeb](https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb), and [TonClient4](https://github.com/ton-org/ton/blob/master/src/client/TonClient4.ts). Just a few code changes and you’re ready to go.

## [](#p-64818-boc-parsing-tool-6)BoC Parsing Tool

Bag of Cells (BoC) is a format for serializing cells into byte arrays. On TON, everything consists of cells, including contract code, stored data, blocks, achieving streamline and robust flexibility in the process.

Our **BoC Parsing Tool** allows developers to easily decode and interpret BoC data. With a TONX API key, you can check BOC on the mainnet or testnet, initiate a request, and instantly view the response to confirm if your BoC is ready to go.

## [](#p-64818-estimate-fee-api-7)Estimate Fee API

In smart contract development and testing, a common challenge is the gap between estimated transaction fees and the actual fees upon execution. This discrepancy often creates an unwanted margin of error.

To address this, our **EstimateFee API** is here. By reflecting real-time conditions, it ensures that the fee shown before broadcasting closely aligns with the final fee charged.

Unlike other tools that estimate fees by statically checking transaction size and other invariable parameters, our API simulate the process of running transactions in the virtual TON blockchain with high fidelity as the real mainnet. This allows us to estimate fee that’s far more accurate and reliable.

> Learn more about the Estimate Fee API: [Estimate Fee](https://docs.tonxapi.com/reference/estimate-fee)

В полях нынче немноголюдно и достаточно сильно наплёвано, поэтому лучше одеть галоши, много кучек коричневого цвета и одна большая куча в которой предположительно поселились хомяки, правда они практически все уже разбежались, видны неторопливые разработчики, видны владельцы каналов, они подписываются теперь друг на друга, чтобы создать видимость хоть какого-то комьюнити, также видны рефераловоды, этим полегче так как среди них много владельцев каналов…и вдалеке в тени видна группа мошенников, что они там делают издалека разглядеть сложно…ну и наконец на берегу речки в шалаше, сидят последние представители своего вида-худые, с повреждёнными пальцами и сумасшедшими глазами тестировщики-тапальщики, они смотрят непонимающим взглядом на игровое поле и улыбаются грустной улыбкой… Что же здесь произошло ведь было так весело и празднично и многолюдно? Почему же все ушли обратно на завод? Пойду и я пожалуй…

А что ту сделаешь… Видимо надо выполнять свои обещания, чтобы слоган ,тапай чтобы заработать, оправдывал ожидания , чтобы юзерам получалось именно заработать, а не получить какие-то 10 долларов, более весомые суммы должны выходить… За реферальными ссылками должны гоняться и искать их, они должны быть в дефиците, нужно чтобы у игроков был азарт  
Безопасность должна работать и отслеживать мошенников, вот у меня только запущенных ботов отвалилось штук 10 уже и это те которые отключились или ещё что-то, либо каналы молчать стали, есть ещё которые насыпали вообще невнятные суммы, что даже комиссия не отбилась… Озвучивать игрокам чёткие понятные условия, допустим ты вложил 10 долларов получишь 20 долларов за счёт того то… Чтобы игроки могли как-то найти деньги и влиться, потому что сейчас получается вкладывать средства стрёмно, а если не вложишь то ничего не получишь, только пальцы сотрёшь да экран на телефоне… И ещё момент думаю, должна быть какая-то финансовая поддержка игроков которые пришли сюда заработать не имея средств для вложений, иными активами, чтобы при airdrop они не сливали монеты проекта и чтобы они понимали, что то что они получили при airdrop это выгодный актив который вырастет, но кушать хочется сейчас и поэтому нужна эта поддержка

> чтобы юзерам получалось именно заработать, а не получить какие-то 10 долларов

они именно зарабатывают, в соответствии с вложенными усилиями

> За реферальными ссылками должны гоняться и искать их, они должны быть в дефиците

суть реферальных ссылок, заманить больше людей в проект, а не дать выгоду тому, кто их генерирует

> Озвучивать игрокам чёткие понятные условия

Не понятно как получится каждый раз. Кроме того, при чётких условиях, будет реагировать меньше аудитории. А если условия очень сладко выглядят, это точно обман.

> чтобы при airdrop они не сливали монеты проекта

Монеты и airdrop существуют лишь для привлечения аудитории, с целью заработка для основателей проектов, а не наоборот.

# [Introducing about NBIT PAY - NOTBITCOIN's payment application](/t/introducing-about-nbit-pay-notbitcoins-payment-application/39585)

The launch of Telegram mini apps represents, in my belief, a breakthrough in ideas that will redefine how we use internet applications for years to come.

Previously, you needed to install numerous separate apps to meet your internet needs: gaming, socializing, reading, watching movies, and more. Each app required its own account and password, adding to the hassle of remembering them all.

Telegram mini apps simplify everything. You no longer need to install apps or create accounts. Simply open your Telegram app and join applications bot.

Realizing this potential, we developed NBIT PAY as a new payment method for Telegram mini apps with no blockchain fee, easy to integrate and use, familiar to all including web3 and web2 users. And what’s more, it’s completely free for everyone to use. NBIT PAY is currently in its final testing phase and will be ready to launch this November 2024.

NBIT PAY card  
If NBIT PAY Telegram mini-app is an online payment application similar to Google Pay, Apple Pay, PayPal,… then NBIT PAY card also promises to become a new offline payment card besides visa, master card. Of course, to be able to use NBIT PAY card payment card is a long way ahead, but that is in NBIT PAY’s development plan in the near future. Below is a sample for NBIT PAY payment card.

# [\[这能用吗\] VM Linker：TON 智能合约的编译与连接工具](/t/vm-linker-ton/396)

[中文 (简繁)](/c/zh/application/55)  [应用](/c/zh/application/55) 

    

[QianXuesen](https://tonresear.ch/u/QianXuesen)   February 19, 2024, 5:36pm  1

TVM Linker 是一个用于编译和连接TON 智能合约的实用工具，它将TVM (TON Virtual Machine) 的组合语言源代码进行编译，连接其部分，添加标准选择器和运行时，并将其存储到二进制 的TVC 文件中。 此外，它还可以通过模拟 TON 交易的计算阶段来立即执行智能合约。

TVM 组合语言可以通过以下 TONLabs 编译器之一生成：

*   TON Solidity 编译器：[点击查看](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-Solidity-Compiler)
*   C 和 C++ 编译器 for TVM：[点击查看](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-Compiler)

## [](#h-1)先决条件

*   最新版本的 Rust
*   Cargo 工具
*   [安装教程](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)

## [](#h-2)构建方法

```
$ cargo update && cargo build --release -j8
```

## [](#h-3)使用方法

TVM Linker 有几种工作模式：

### [](#h-1-4)1) 生成准备部署的合约

```
$ tvm_linker compile [--lib <lib_file>] [--abi-json <abi_file>] [-w <workchain_id>] [--debug] [--print_code] [--silent] [--debug-map < debug_info_path>] <source>
```

### [](#h-2-boc-5)2) 解码外部准备的 .boc 消息

```
$ tvm_linker decode [--tvc] boc-file
```

### [](#h-3-boc-6)3) 准备外部入站消息的 .boc 格式

```
$ tvm_linker message <contract-address> [--init] [--data] [-w]
$ tvm_linker message <contract-address> [--init] --abi-json <abi_file> --abi-method <method_name> --abi-params {json_with_params} [-w]
```

### [](#h-4-7)4) 模拟合约执行

```
$ tvm_linker test <contract-address> --body XXXX... [--sign key-file] [--trace] [--decode-c6] [--internal <value>] [--src address] [ --now unixtime] [-s source-file] [--balance <value>]
```

### [](#h-5-8)5) 反汇编器

```
$ tvm_linker disasm dump <tvc-file>
$ tvm_linker disasm text <tvc-file>
$ tvm_linker disasm graphviz <tvc-file>
```

更多帮助信息，请使用 `tvm_linker --help` 查看所有选项、标志和子命令的详细描述。

## [](#h-9)输入格式

作为一种临时措施，使用了一些类似 LLVM 组合语言的输入格式。 源代码应该包含几种函数类型：

*   `.internal` - 仅由合约的运行时使用的特殊函数，例如 `main_external`、`main_internal`、`onTickTock`、`onBounce`。

## [](#h-10)支持

I’ve noticed that the [in-game activity contract](https://tonviewer.com/EQChB2eMoFG4ThuEsZ6ehlBPKJXOjNxlR5B7qKZNGIv256Da) used on Catizen has a network fee of 0.0029 TON and a base resource consumption fee of 0.0034 TON. Is there any way to reduce these costs or adjust them?

# [\[Можно ли использовать этот код?\] Оптимизация и использование утилиты tvm\_linker в блокчейне TON](/t/tvm-linker-ton/397)

[Русский](/c/ru/general/50)  [General](/c/ru/general/50) 

    

[IvanKriptov](https://tonresear.ch/u/IvanKriptov)   February 19, 2024, 5:39pm  1

В данном посте мы рассмотрим технические аспекты утилиты tvm\_linker, предназначенной для компиляции и связывания исходного кода ассемблера TVM смарт-контрактов в блокчейне TON (The Open Network). Утилита tvm\_linker позволяет преобразовать исходный код в двоичный файл TVC, а также эмулировать фазу вычислений транзакции TON.

#### [](#h-1)Предварительные условия:

*   Последняя версия Rust
*   Инструмент Cargo  
    [Скачать их можно здесь](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)

#### [](#h-2)Как собрать:

```
$ cargo update && cargo build --release -j8
```

#### [](#h-3)Как использовать:

tvm\_linker имеет несколько режимов работы:

1.  **Генерация готового к развертыванию контракта:**
    
    ```
    $ tvm_linker compile [--lib <lib_file>] [--abi-json <abi_file>] [-w <workchain_id>] [--debug] [--print_code] [--silent] [--debug-map <debug_info_path>] <source>
    ```
    
2.  **Декодирование .boc сообщений, подготовленных внешним образом:**
    
    ```
    $ tvm_linker decode [--tvc] boc-file
    ```
    
3.  **Подготовка внешних входящих сообщений в формате .boc:**
    
    ```
    $ tvm_linker message <contract-address> [--init] [--data] [-w]
    ```
    
4.  **Эмуляция выполнения контракта:**
    
    ```
    $ tvm_linker test <contract-address> --body XXXX... [--sign key-file] [--trace] [--decode-c6] [--internal <value>] [--src address] [--now unixtime] [-s source-file] [--balance <value>]
    ```
    
5.  **Дизассемблер:**
    
    *   `dump` выводит псевдографическое представление дерева ячеек.
    *   `text` дизассемблирует tvc, созданный компиляторами Solidity и FunC.
    *   `graphviz` создает вывод в формате dot для генерации графического представления DAG tvc.

# [](#p-65172-background-1)Background

[@Alan](/u/alan) 和我最近嘗試在 FunC 中實現多型，使用三元運算符來決定執行哪個函數。然而，我們遇到了一個奇怪的問題：儘管我們將 `sum()` 和 `mul()` 都標記為 **impure**，但如果函數的返回值未被使用，函數內的任何錯誤卻未按照預期拋出。

**這很奇怪，因為按照 impure 修飾符的邏輯，即使返回值未被使用，函數也應該拋出錯誤。**

# [](#p-65172-description-2)Description

下圖為我們使用的範例 functions:

[![image](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/d/bd736a0c07c930f7c3a108b1fce4c7b564bcf4ea_2_690x485.png)

In the main program:

[![image](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/8/9/89a3b496a5f5f599ed7eb69f9980290c89850c2a_2_690x356.png)

當返回值被使用時（如在 `op::with_dump` 的情況下），錯誤會正確地被拋出。然而，在 `op::without_dump` 的情況下，由於返回值未被使用，即使函數已標記為 **impure**，錯誤卻未被拋出。您可以參考此[測試案例](https://github.com/ipromise2324/FunC-Impure-Test/blob/20810b2ffce045d5d8a107fc464db570041544c7/tests/Test.spec.ts#L18)，理論上它應該拋出錯誤，但其狀態卻顯示為成功。

這種行為令人困惑，因為理論上 **impure** 函數應該無論返回值是否被使用都會觸發錯誤。我們還進行了額外的測試，例如直接調用函數而不使用返回值，在這些情況下，錯誤能夠成功地被拋出。您可以參考下方的圖片，當直接調用 `sum()` 和 `mul()` 時，無論是否使用返回值，錯誤都能成功被拋出。

2.  Broad EVM and Non-EVM Compatibility: Supporting both EVM and non-EVM ecosystems, including TON, Sui, Near, Aptos, and Hedera, Emmet.Finance offers unmatched interoperability across diverse blockchain networks.
    
3.  Flexible Token Integration: Beyond just blue-chip tokens, Emmet enables quick integration of any ERC20 or relevant protocol tokens, making it ideal for a variety of projects and token types.
    
4.  Comprehensive DEX Integration: Emmet facilitates cross-chain and cross-protocol DEX operations, integrating EVM DEXs like Uniswap, PancakeSwap, Balancer, and AAVE with TON’s [Ston.fi](http://Ston.fi) and DeDust, allowing for extensive trading across ecosystems.
    
5.  Modular Bridge Design: Emmet.Finance bridge includes four specialized modules, each catering to unique bridging requirements:
    
    *   Lock & Mint Module: Enables secure asset bridging by locking assets on one chain and minting corresponding tokens on the destination chain.
        
    *   Liquidity Pool-Based Module: Provides liquidity for seamless cross-chain transfers with minimized slippage and optimized capital efficiency.
        
    *   CCTP-Based Module: Ensures compatibility with Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol, leveraging stablecoin liquidity for cross-chain transactions.
        
    *   Swap-Based Module: Supports up to six swap protocols per chain, enabling smooth asset swaps across networks with maximum liquidity.
        

This comprehensive modular architecture makes Emmet.Finance one of the most versatile and powerful bridging solutions available today.

Навеяка многие уже пробовали функцию создания мемов в Блуме. Но не понятно как, они работают?

Имею ли я права на этот мем,

Почему можно создавать одинаковые тикеры и как забронировать уникальный тег.

Я создал, что делать дальше?

# [\[Has anyone successfully tested it?\] Optimizing TVM Linker for TON Blockchain: A Technical Deep Dive 🚀](/t/has-anyone-successfully-tested-it-optimizing-tvm-linker-for-ton-blockchain-a-technical-deep-dive/398)

[General](/c/general/4) 

    

[Einstein](https://tonresear.ch/u/Einstein)   February 19, 2024, 5:44pm  1

The TVM Linker is a crucial utility for the TON Blockchain (The Open Network), responsible for compiling and linking TVM (TON Virtual Machine) assembly source code of TON smart contracts. It transforms the assembly code into a binary TVC file, adds standard selectors and runtime, and can even emulate the computing phase of a TON transaction.

## [](#prerequisites-1)Prerequisites ![:hammer_and_wrench:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/hammer_and_wrench.png?v=12 ":hammer_and_wrench:")

Before diving into the TVM Linker, ensure you have the latest version of Rust and the Cargo tool installed. You can find the installation guide [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

## [](#building-the-tvm-linker-2)Building the TVM Linker ![:wrench:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/wrench.png?v=12 ":wrench:")

To build the TVM Linker, execute the following command:

```
cargo update && cargo build --release -j8
```

## [](#usage-modes-of-tvm-linker-3)Usage Modes of TVM Linker ![:open_book:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/open_book.png?v=12 ":open_book:")

### [](#h-1-generating-a-ready-to-deploy-contract-4)1\. Generating a Ready-to-Deploy Contract

To compile a TVM assembly source file into a deployable contract, use the following command:

```
tvm_linker compile [--lib <lib_file>] [--abi-json <abi_file>] [-w <workchain_id>] [--debug] [--print_code] [--silent] [--debug-map <debug_info_path>] <source>
```

*   `<source>`: TVM assembly source file name.
*   `--lib <lib_file>`: Runtime library file. Multiple libraries can be specified.
*   `--abi-json <abi_file>`: Contract ABI file to generate function IDs according to ABI signatures.
*   `-w <workchain_id>`: Workchain ID for generating user-friendly addresses. Default is -1.
*   `--debug-map <debug_info_path>`: Generates a debug info file for contract debugging.
*   `--print_code`: Prints the generated code without creating a TVC file.
*   `--silent`: Mutes extra notifications.

### [](#h-2-decoding-boc-messages-5)2\. Decoding .boc Messages

To decode externally prepared .boc messages, use:

```
tvm_linker decode [--tvc] <boc-file>
```

### [](#h-3-preparing-external-inbound-messages-6)3\. Preparing External Inbound Messages

First, generate a contract as described in step 1. Then, create an external inbound message in boc format using:

```
tvm_linker message <contract-address> [--init] [--data] [-w]
tvm_linker message <contract-address> [--init] --abi-json <abi_file> --abi-method <method_name> --abi-params {json_with_params} [-w]
```

*   `--init`: Creates a constructor message with contract’s code and data.
*   `--data <data_string>`: Adds a raw body to the message in hex format.
*   `--abi-json`, `--abi-method`, `--abi-params`: Specifies ABI details for the message.

### [](#h-4-emulating-contract-execution-7)4\. Emulating Contract Execution

For contract debugging, the linker can emulate the compute phase of a blockchain transaction:

```
tvm_linker test <contract-address> --body XXXX... [--sign key-file] [--trace] [--decode-c6] [--internal <value>] [--src address] [--now unixtime] [-s source-file] [--balance <value>]
```

*   `--body XXXX...`: Hex string representing the message body.
*   `--sign key-file`: Signs the body with a private key.
*   `--trace`: Traces VM execution.
*   `--decode-c6`: Outputs actions in a user-friendly format.
*   `--internal <value>`: Sends an internal message with specified nanograms.
*   `--src address`: Source address for the internal message.
*   `--now unixtime`: Sets transaction creation time.

### [](#h-5-disassembler-tools-8)5\. Disassembler Tools

The TVM Linker also provides disassembler tools for analyzing TVC files:

*   `dump`: Outputs a pseudo-graphical representation of a cell tree.
*   `text`: Disassembles TVC files produced by Solidity and FunC compilers.
*   `graphviz`: Generates a graphical DAG representation in dot format.

For more detailed information on all options, flags, and subcommands, use `tvm_linker --help`.

## [](#support-and-resources-9)Support and Resources ![:books:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/books.png?v=12 ":books:")

Try the free trial for 5 days. After the trial, it’s $60 per month. $60 per month to find a job with a salary >$100k per year!

We have had questions about how you are better than the usual web3 job boards which are free to the user. My answer is: These job boards have paid placement of jobs, so this board cannot have a large market coverage a priori. We have decided to change this business model. We want to give the user as many jobs as possible, but make the use of the tool paid. I am sure that both we and the market will benefit from this business model. It will allow us to focus on getting 100% of the crypto-related vacancies covered. And the user will get more responses and be the first to find new vacancies.

We have a referral programme in the product. If you have crypto traffic or traffic related to HRtech - you should be a part of our referral programme.

Version 4 introduced a range of new TVM instructions, including `PREVMCBLOCKS`, `PREVKEYBLOCK`, `GLOBALID`, `HASHEXT(A)(R)`, `ECRECOVER`, `SENDMSG`, `RUNVM`, `RUNVMX`, `GASCONSUMED`, and various `RIST255_...` and `BLS_...` instructions. The division instruction was enhanced to allow adding a number to the intermediate value before division. Stack operations saw improvements with unlimited arguments for certain operations and increased gas consumption for large arguments. The c7 tuple was extended to include additional elements such as the smart contract’s code, the incoming message’s value, fees collected in the storage phase, and information about previous blocks. Changes were also made to the action and storage phases, including requirements for failed “send message” actions and adjustments in unpaid storage fee handling.

### [](#version-5-4)Version 5

Version 5 focused on optimizing gas limits and library loading. Gas limits for transactions on special contracts were significantly increased, allowing for higher gas consumption without affecting block limits. Changes were made to the handling of library cells, including the prohibition of “nested libraries” and modifications to the `XLOAD` instruction. These changes aimed to improve the efficiency and reliability of library usage in smart contracts.

### [](#version-6-5)Version 6

The most recent update, Version 6, continued to expand the c7 tuple, now including config parameters as cell slices and the current debt for storage fees. New TVM instructions were introduced for more precise fee calculations, such as `GETGASFEE`, `GETSTORAGEFEE`, `GETFORWARDFEE`, and `GETORIGINALFWDFEE`. Additionally, cell operations were enhanced to support Merkle proofs with non-zero level cells, including instructions like `CLEVEL`, `CLEVELMASK`, `CHASHI`, `CDEPTHI`, `CHASHIX`, and `CDEPTHIX`. These improvements aimed to optimize gas usage and provide more flexibility in smart contract development.

## [](#conclusion-6)Conclusion

The evolution of global versions in TON Blockchain demonstrates a continuous effort to enhance the platform’s capabilities, efficiency, and security. Each version brings new features and optimizations that cater to the growing demands of blockchain technology and its applications. As TON Blockchain progresses, it is expected that future versions will continue to introduce innovative changes, further solidifying its position as a leading blockchain platform.

13.  \*\*Briefly describe your memecoin’s strategy for growth and community engagement:  
    The Mr. MeMe game is a competitive crypto project using the first multi-chain community token MMM that plans to become the largest meme in history.
    

Players participate in cyclical seasons where they farm points and compete for a share of the overall reward pool. To participate in farming, a player needs to log in via Telegram bot or website and activate the point farming process.

The main feature of the Mr. MeMe game is tying the gameplay to the MMM meme token. Players can increase their chances of winning by leveling up their account through the purchase of MMM tokens, which increases the farming power and unlocks additional benefits such as autofarming. Interaction with other players also plays an important role: invited friends increase the power of farming, which encourages social interaction and community growth. The MMM token across all networks is launched through memcoin launch sites.\*\*

# [Analyzing the Impact of Inscriptions on the TON Ecosystem: Challenges, Popularity, and Future Use Cases](/t/analyzing-the-impact-of-inscriptions-on-the-ton-ecosystem-challenges-popularity-and-future-use-cases/40)

[Application](/c/application/20) 

    

[kingsman](https://tonresear.ch/u/kingsman)  January 23, 2024, 1:53pm  1

The introduction of inscriptions on The Open Network (TON) has marked a significant milestone, leading to substantial increases in transaction volumes and network activity. This development raises important questions regarding the technical and economic implications for TON and the broader blockchain ecosystem. In this context, we seek to explore several key aspects of inscriptions and their impact.

1.  What are inscriptions, and how do they fundamentally differ from traditional tokens on blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum? Discuss the technical underpinnings of inscriptions, especially their development from the Ordinals protocol and adaptation across various blockchain networks.
2.  The launch of inscriptions on TON led to a dramatic surge in network activity, with a marked increase in transactions and new users. How did these inscriptions contribute to such a significant growth, and what does this suggest about their role in blockchain ecosystems?
3.  Inscriptions have caused increased blockchain activity and associated challenges, such as network congestion and high transaction fees on platforms like Bitcoin and Ethereum. How has TON managed these challenges differently, especially given its unique infrastructure and fixed fee structure?
4.  Given the rapid adoption and surging popularity of inscriptions across multiple blockchains, what factors have contributed to this trend? Analyze the aspects of novelty, lower transaction costs, ease of creation, and speculative appeal in driving the popularity of inscriptions.
5.  Why is TON particularly suited for the adoption and success of inscriptions, considering factors such as its high transaction throughput, stable fee structure, and integration with Telegram?
6.  Explore the primary use cases for inscriptions, focusing on their potential as a fair token launch mechanism and as collectibles or NFTs. How do these use cases compare and contrast with those of traditional smart contract-based tokens?
7.  Finally, looking forward, what are the potential long-term impacts of inscriptions on blockchain technology and digital asset ecosystems? Discuss both the opportunities and challenges that inscriptions present for developers, users, and the broader blockchain community.

This comprehensive discussion aims to provide a deep dive into the world of inscriptions, their technical intricacies, impact on network dynamics, and potential future applications within the TON Ecosystem and beyond. We encourage contributions from experts in blockchain technology, cryptography, and digital asset economics to enrich this conversation.

Hello, I am a member of PumpMeme. We want to apply to participate in The Open League, but we cannot create it in the DEFI category. Instead, we create it under the theme of the Open League. Can you help me solve this problem? Thank you.

 

[Rusty](https://tonresear.ch/u/Rusty) December 5, 2024, 3:26am  8

Hey [@Pump\_MEME](/u/pump_meme) - you probably meant to post on a different channel. You should reach out to the Open League team by making a post in the root of this forum.

 

[Pump\_MEME](https://tonresear.ch/u/Pump_MEME) December 5, 2024, 5:51am  9

Thanks for your reply [@Rusty](/u/rusty) . I posted a thread in The Open League section, but the official staff has not contacted me yet, so I am thinking about whether I can contact them through this method [@openleaguesupport](/u/openleaguesupport) . I originally wanted to post in the Defi League category, but that is not allowed.

Following our ongoing assessment of bonding curve memepads on the TON mainnet and in line with our **eligibility criteria**, we are thrilled to announce that **Blum** has been selected as the next grantee in the TON Memelandia Grant Program.

Blum has finally rolled out their memepad to an impressive 87 million total users, with 35.5 million monthly active users (MAU)!

In just a few days since the initial app rollout, Blum has managed to meet the eligibility criteria and secure a $500,000 grant. It has thus become the fourth participant of the TON Memelandia’s grant program for memepads!

**How Can Other Memepads Apply?**

Any memepad that meets the eligibility criteria can apply to the Grant Program. The initiative is ongoing and accepts new submissions continuously.

How to get started

# [](#p-66033-how-to-earn-pog-on-the-telgather-platform-bot-4)How to Earn POG on the Telgather Platform Bot

Telgather offers several exciting ways to earn POG today, with even more features coming soon! Here’s what’s available now:

1.  **Invite Your Friends:** Invite friends to join the Telgather bot and earn **POG** for each successful referral! For every invite to be valid, your friend needs to **log into the bot** and **link their Telegram account**. Once your friend is on board, you’ll get **15% of whatever POG they earn** — every time they earn! So the more active your friends are, the more POG you collect.
2.  **Play Games:** Jump into our available games: **Banana** ![:banana:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/banana.png?v=12 ":banana:") and **Fintastic** ![:fish:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/fish.png?v=12 ":fish:")! These games are not only fun but also a great way to rack up POG as you play. Plus, with **Animal Combo** and more games on the way, there will be endless opportunities to earn even more.

# [](#p-66033-what-is-tog-5)What is $TOG?

As we prepare for the **Telgather** platform’s full launch in November, we’re excited to introduce the \*\*TOG token\*\*, which will be listed on exchanges. By accumulating \*\*POG\*\* now, you’re securing your spot to convert those points into **TOG tokens** during the official launch. It’s a simple equation: more POG = more TOG (not 1:1 ratio). Don’t miss your chance to get in early and be part of this growing ecosystem!

# [](#p-66033-why-pog-matters-6)Why POG Matters

Here’s why POG is your ticket to the future:

*   **Warrant for TOG**: POG is the only way to earn **TOG tokens** when the official listing happens in **November**.
*   **Referral Rebates**: With every successful invite, you’re not only boosting your POG balance but also setting up long-term rewards through the **15% rebate** on every POG your friend earns.
*   **Game Rewards**: Whether it’s Banana, Fintastic, or future releases, you can continuously accumulate POG by playing the games you love.

# [](#p-66033-carvs-support-in-powering-telgather-7)CARV’s Support in Powering Telgather

We couldn’t have built this incredible ecosystem without the support of **CARV**. They’ve been instrumental in providing the **modular data infrastructure** that allows us to seamlessly store user data and manage rewards. With **CARV ID**, we’ve created a system where POG distribution is smooth, secure, and instant, ensuring that you get rewarded for every action you take on Telgather.

# [](#p-66033-fast-paced-game-development-and-the-road-to-november-8)Fast-Paced Game Development and the Road to November

Our team is working tirelessly to bring you the best possible experience. We’re moving at a rapid pace, developing top-quality games that are both engaging and rewarding. With each new release, we aim to provide more ways for you to earn POG and immerse yourself in the Telgather universe.

As we approach the **November listing** of **TOG**, we’re excited about the future of Telgather and all the features we’re planning to roll out. From new games like **Animal Combo** to other highly anticipated platform features, there’s plenty to look forward to.

2.  **Play Games:** Jump into our available games: **Banana** ![:banana:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/banana.png?v=12 ":banana:") and **Fintastic** ![:fish:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/fish.png?v=12 ":fish:")! These games are not only fun but also a great way to rack up POG as you play. Plus, with **Animal Combo** and more games on the way, there will be endless opportunities to earn even more.

# [](#p-66033-what-is-tog-20)What is $TOG?

As we prepare for the **Telgather** platform’s full launch in November, we’re excited to introduce the \*\*TOG token\*\*, which will be listed on exchanges. By accumulating \*\*POG\*\* now, you’re securing your spot to convert those points into **TOG tokens** during the official launch. It’s a simple equation: more POG = more TOG (not 1:1 ratio). Don’t miss your chance to get in early and be part of this growing ecosystem!

# [](#p-66033-why-pog-matters-21)Why POG Matters

Here’s why POG is your ticket to the future:

*   **Warrant for TOG**: POG is the only way to earn **TOG tokens** when the official listing happens in **November**.
*   **Referral Rebates**: With every successful invite, you’re not only boosting your POG balance but also setting up long-term rewards through the **15% rebate** on every POG your friend earns.
*   **Game Rewards**: Whether it’s Banana, Fintastic, or future releases, you can continuously accumulate POG by playing the games you love.

# [](#p-66033-carvs-support-in-powering-telgather-22)CARV’s Support in Powering Telgather

We couldn’t have built this incredible ecosystem without the support of **CARV**. They’ve been instrumental in providing the **modular data infrastructure** that allows us to seamlessly store user data and manage rewards. With **CARV ID**, we’ve created a system where POG distribution is smooth, secure, and instant, ensuring that you get rewarded for every action you take on Telgather.

# [](#p-66033-fast-paced-game-development-and-the-road-to-november-23)Fast-Paced Game Development and the Road to November

Our team is working tirelessly to bring you the best possible experience. We’re moving at a rapid pace, developing top-quality games that are both engaging and rewarding. With each new release, we aim to provide more ways for you to earn POG and immerse yourself in the Telgather universe.

As we approach the **November listing** of **TOG**, we’re excited about the future of Telgather and all the features we’re planning to roll out. From new games like **Animal Combo** to other highly anticipated platform features, there’s plenty to look forward to.

Game List for Oct

# [](#p-66033-first-second-batch-of-pog-distribution-1000000-pog-sent-out-24)First & Second Batch of POG Distribution: 1,000,000+ POG Sent Out!

In case you missed it, we’ve already distributed 1,300\*\*,000 POG\*\* already! But don’t worry if you weren’t part of that — there’s another batch coming soon, and it’s not too late to start earning your share. Get in on the action now and be ready for the next POG drop!

# [](#p-66033-whats-next-25)What’s Next?

The future of Telgather is bright! We’re just getting started, and with $**TOG** coming in November, now is the time to rack up as much POG as you can. Whether you’re inviting friends, playing games, or waiting for new features, every action counts toward your POG balance — and ultimately, your stake in the Telgather economy.

So what are you waiting for? **Join the Telgather platform bot today**, start earning POG, and get ready for even greater things to come! ![:tada:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/tada.png?v=12 ":tada:")

You will notice that the top ranking meme for ETH and SOL are 2 dogs .  
If you are careful, you will find that these two dogs exist in two styles, like cute and cool, like community and capital, and they meet the needs of mass distribution and originality.

Why is this so, because such invisible hand so as to cover the vast majority of users. It constitutes a competitive relationship. This is a business model.

If you pick 2 dogs in the TON, the ones who are satisfied are REDO and OR, because the other dogs are like copies of REDO.

ETH market cap market cap 400B. sol market cap 90B (4-5X difference) TON market cap 17B (4-5X difference)

ETH DOGE (CUTE) 20B SHIB (COOL) 10B  
SOL WIF (CUTE) 2.5b BONK (COOL) 2b  
TON REDO (COOL) 0.5B OR (CUTE) ?B

In the distant world of cryptocurrencies, where tokens were born and disappeared with lightning speed, a unique project appeared — the $Vilarso token. Its logo, depicting a majestic Phoenix bird, symbolized rebirth, hope, and the desire for new heights. This bird, flying upward, became the personification of the ambitions and dreams of those who believed in the future of crypto investments.

I have been following the Vilarso trader for a long time. I took part in his Crypto hangout. Vilarso is a man who values his reputation! Honor is more important to him than money. He recently created a token. After the news about it came out, I immediately bought it and did not regret it for a second. I am glad to be a part of the team! Peace, health and profit to all!

Давно слежу за трейдером Vilarso. Принимал участие в его Крипто тусовке. Vilarso- человек, который дорожит своей репутацией! Для него честь дороже денег. Недавно он создал токен. После выхода новости об этом, я сразу его купил и ни секунды не пожалел об этом. Рад быть частью команды! Всем мира, здоровья и профита!

# [如何选择 ton 的合约编程语言？](/t/ton/40547)

[中文 (简繁)](/c/zh/ton-blockchain/52)  [TON 区块链](/c/zh/ton-blockchain/52) 

    

[andrew](https://tonresear.ch/u/andrew)  December 4, 2024, 9:45am  1

# [](#p-66828-h-1)一、简介

TON 提供了多个合约编程语言，分别从虚拟机底层到高级业务抽象的角度提供合约编写能力，然而多个合约编程语言会给新加入的开发者带来选择困难，本文将分析其中的区别，帮助大家选择合适的编程语言。

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*npeXw1Nvoe6-7Fqe-A8vpg.png)

如上面图表所示，从左到右，分别是从简单到复杂，从高层业务抽象到底层指令集进行排序。每个编程语言都有它的产生的背景和作用，如果用自然语言的进化来类比，类似从旁边部首到甲骨文，再到繁体简体汉字，以及辅助学习的拼音。

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*7zSD8mPCoJzroml-vbP0Vw.png)

有一个明确的趋势是，Tolk 虽然是 24 年 10 月刚发布，但是 Tolk 的目标是作为 FunC 的继任者，不久的将来会变成 TON 最主流的合约编程语言，但是当前 Tolk 的文档和代码案例还在抓紧编写中，需要一个过渡时间。

# [](#p-66828-h-2)二、选择哪个？

如下图所示，根据你的目的来选择合适的语言，如果是初学者，建议从 Tact 入门，然后过渡到 FunC 和 Tolk。如果需要在 TON 上快速发行资产，当前有丰富的 FunC 代码模版，直接使用或者学一点 FunC 就可以快速完成项目需求。 如果是新项目并且链上逻辑比较复杂，比如是新的 DeFi 项目，则推荐使用 Tolk 进行构建。

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*aGFlEiotlOT0YnYrKjugTw.jpeg)

> 2025 年我会更新这个指南，到时候应该可以去掉 FunC，直接推荐使用 Tolk。

# [Ton区块链全局版本的技术进展](/t/ton/406)

[中文 (简繁)](/c/zh/application/55)  [应用](/c/zh/application/55) 

    

[QianXuesen](https://tonresear.ch/u/QianXuesen)  February 19, 2024, 6:04pm  1

TON区块链（The Open Network）随着不同的全局版本的推出，引入了一系列技术进步和新功能。这些版本通过`ConfigParam 8`中指定的参数来启用各种特性。

## [](#h-1)全局版本概览

全局版本是TON区块链中的一个关键参数，决定了哪些功能被激活。下表总结了不同全局版本中启用的主要特性：

全局版本

主要特性

版本 4

新的TVM指令、除法增强、c7元组扩展、动作和存储阶段修改

版本 5

特殊合约的高 gas 限制、库加载变化、 gas 计算调整

版本 6

c7元组进一步扩展、新的TVM指令用于费用计算和单元操作、 gas 使用优化

## [](#h-2)各版本详细分析

### [](#h-4-3)版本 4

版本4引入了一系列新的TVM指令，包括`PREVMCBLOCKS`、`PREVKEYBLOCK`、`GLOBALID`、`HASHEXT(A)(R)`、`ECRECOVER`、`SENDMSG`、`RUNVM`、`RUNVMX`、`GASCONSUMED`以及各种`RIST255_...`和`BLS_...`指令。除法指令得到增强，允许在除法前向中间值添加数字。堆栈操作有所改进，某些操作的参数现在无限制，并且当参数较大时，`ROLL`、`ROLLREV`、`BLKSWX`、`REVX`、`ONLYTOPX`的 gas 消耗增加。c7元组扩展到包括额外的元素，如智能合约的代码、传入消息的值、存储阶段收集的费用以及关于前几个区块的信息。动作和存储阶段也进行了更改，包括对失败的“发送消息”动作的要求和未付存储费用的处理调整。

### [](#h-5-4)版本 5

版本5专注于优化 gas 限制和库加载。特殊合约的交易 gas 限制显著增加，允许更高的 gas 消耗而不影响区块限制。对库单元的处理进行了更改，包括禁止“嵌套库”和修改`XLOAD`指令。这些更改旨在提高库在智能合约中使用的效率和可靠性。

### [](#h-6-5)版本 6

最新更新的版本6继续扩展c7元组，现在包括作为单元切片的一些配置参数和当前存储费用的债务。引入了新的TVM指令，用于更精确的费用计算，如`GETGASFEE`、`GETSTORAGEFEE`、`GETFORWARDFEE`和`GETORIGINALFWDFEE`。此外，单元操作得到增强，以支持具有非零级别和多个哈希的单元的Merkle证明，包括`CLEVEL`、`CLEVELMASK`、`CHASHI`、`CDEPTHI`、`CHASHIX`和`CDEPTHIX`指令。这些改进旨在优化 gas 使用并为智能合约开发提供更多灵活性。

## [](#h-6)结论

TON区块链全局版本的演变展示了对提高平台能力、效率和安全性的持续

努力。每个版本都带来了新的特性和优化，满足了区块链技术及其应用不断增长的需求。随着TON区块链的发展，预计未来的版本将继续引入创新变化，进一步巩固其作为领先区块链平台的地位。

[erdchem](https://tonresear.ch/u/erdchem)  December 9, 2024, 9:50pm  1

hello first of all  
I’m thinking of developing a project, but I have questions that I can’t solve.

1.  How does [fragment.com](http://fragment.com) get stars?
2.  Do we have the opportunity to get stars like [fragment.com](http://fragment.com)?  
    Even though we cannot buy it as cheaply as fragments, is there a way to get stars, even if it is expensive, through an API from Telegram?

Best regards to community.

1.  Fragment doesn’t get stars; it simply sells. This means you’re making a Web 3.0 transaction to purchase a Web 2.0 digital asset.
    
2.  There is no legal way to obtain stars directly. However, you can verify your own account on [Fragment.com](http://fragment.com/) and buy stars for your friends. Some services are now parsing Ref\_IDs from Fragment and conducting transactions from verified wallets that resemble typical user transactions on Fragment. But be cautious when doing this.

# [Обзор StarHash. Дроп ~февраль 2025? реклама в Notpixel на StarHash?](/t/starhash-2025-notpixel-starhash/40691)

[Русский](/c/ru/49) 

    

[FizHowe](https://tonresear.ch/u/FizHowe)  December 15, 2024, 3:57pm  1

В многоуважаемом приложении **Notpixel** засветился новый проект **StarsHash**. Давайте разберем основные моменты

«**Вы используете мощность своего устройства для решения какой-то капчи, получая за это токены**»

Так заявляют в официальном телеграм канале

Самое интересное - Майнинг продолжится до тех пор, пока не будут сгенерированы все 1 000 000 блоков (~**февраль 2025 г**.)

Если судить по опыту **#Memhash**, самую высокую прибыль получили первые участники, на данный момент сильно уменьшилась прибыль, но и вход стоит дешевле, всего 100 звезд, сейчас memhash находится топ 1 по кассовым приложениям

В StarsHash сейчас вход стоит 490 звезд, в Memhash стоило **400-600-800** на старте, поэтому лучше не томить в случае интереса

Если уж в Notpixel рекламирует, деньги на развитие явно есть у проекта, на фомо можно залететь

[StarsHash перейти](https://api.vc.ru/v2.8/redirect?to=https%3A%2F%2Ft.me%2Fstarshash_bot%3Fstart%3D_tgr_idCCMlk4ODMy&postId=1710457)

Данный проект обладает потенциалом, посмотрим что из этого выйдет

Hey guys I’m Marceau, I’m working at Ta-da, a platform that collects data for AI. The purpose is simple, we create tasks for companies that need data to train their AI in our app, and the community is rewarded for providing and checking the data quality to ensure it matches the requirements. This can be voice, pictures, videos, annotation, anything that can be done through a smartphone basically.

We’d love to add tasks for projects in need for data and list partners within our app!

We are about to launch on TON very soon, and we have grants and micro-grants programs going on, who could help us move forward with that and create synergies between projects ?

All the best,  
Marceau

Dear scammers! After completing your vile actions, please turn off the bots that have been worked on, because you will not take anything from these players and they are wasting their time, you better create a new bot and invite them there. Have at least a little respect for people, you still have a lot of work to do with them…

While TON Foundation is a more familiar name, few know the story of its early contributors—the **NEWTON team (TON Core Team).**

> Through voluntary technical contributions, NEWTON earned recognition from  
> [@Telegram](https://x.com/@Telegram)’s official team in 2021, leading to the technical handover that marked the greatest “Community Takeover” in blockchain history.

As an early member of NEWTON, let me share this story. ![:writing_hand:t2:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/writing_hand/2.png?v=12 ":writing_hand:t2:")

## [](#p-67291-introduction-joining-the-newton-team-and-its-mission-1)Introduction: Joining the NEWTON Team and Its Mission

When I joined the NEWTON team, our primary mission was clear: maintain the stability of the TON testnet2 code while enhancing developer tools.

Since we didn’t have direct control over the [ton-blockchain GitHub repository](https://github.com/ton-blockchain), we created a new organization called [NEWTON](https://github.com/newton-blockchain).  
To ensure smooth network updates, we encouraged the community to use NEWTON-developed validators as the standard version.

Between our founding and June 2021, the NEWTON Team accomplished several groundbreaking developments and infrastructure projects. Let’s dive into **10 critical contributions** that shaped TON’s early days.

* * *

## [](#p-67291-h-1-mytonctrl-automated-node-management-tool-2)1\. mytonctrl: Automated Node Management Tool

Our first major contribution was **mytonctrl**, a powerful automation tool for node installation and validator setup.

Features included:

*   Wallet creation
*   Contract deployment
*   Transaction history retrieval
*   DNS registration system (distinct from the modern NFT-packaged DNS)

Additionally, **mytonctrl** could configure validators, liteservers, and liteclients, simplifying node data access and parsing.

By 2021, we added CPU-based mining scripts and automated power tests to facilitate [$TON](https://x.com/search?q=%24TON&src=cashtag_click) mining.

* * *

## [](#p-67291-h-2-tonmon-visualizing-blockchain-health-3)2\. tonmon: Visualizing Blockchain Health

We created [tonmon](https://tonmon.xyz/) to monitor blockchain health.  
Key metrics included:

*   Block creation times
*   Shard statuses
*   dPoS election schedules
*   Validator counts and weights

> In the early days, the network had only ~80 validators globally.

[![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GdeXWtIXoAArNQr?format=jpg&name=medium)](https://x.com/drawesomedoge/article/1862377110381502883/media/1862123387268603904)

* * *

## [](#p-67291-h-3-tonmine-monitoring-giver-contracts-4)3\. tonmine: Monitoring Giver Contracts

[tonmine](https://tonmine.xyz/) tracked TON mining activity.  
By 2021, only ten small givers remained, distributing ~200,000 [$TON](https://x.com/search?q=%24TON&src=cashtag_click) daily across all contracts.

> Mining difficulty varied significantly depending on the giver.

[![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GdeXoOfX0AAmL6E?format=jpg&name=medium)](https://x.com/drawesomedoge/article/1862377110381502883/media/1862123688281231360)

* * *

## [](#p-67291-h-4-cross-chain-bridge-5)4\. Cross-Chain Bridge

Before jetton or NFT standards, we developed a **native [$TON](https://x.com/search?q=%24TON&src=cashtag_click) bridge** for ERC-20 tokens on EVM-compatible chains.  
This enabled seamless transfers between TON, Ethereum, and BSC via [bridge.ton.org](https://bridge.ton.org/).

* * *

## [](#p-67291-h-5-cryptobothttpsxcomcryptobot-telegram-bot-wallet-6)5\. [@cryptobot](https://x.com/@cryptobot): Telegram Bot Wallet

In 2021, we developed [@cryptobot](https://x.com/@cryptobot), a Telegram wallet supporting:

*   [$BTC](https://x.com/search?q=%24BTC&src=cashtag_click)
*   [$TON](https://x.com/search?q=%24TON&src=cashtag_click)

* * *

## [](#p-67291-h-6-toncenter-simplifying-blockchain-data-access-7)6\. toncenter: Simplifying Blockchain Data Access

[toncenter](https://toncenter.com/) provided public APIs for developers, removing the need to set up full nodes or worry about serialized data formats.

> toncenter paved the way for modern APIs like [tonxapi.com](https://tonxapi.com/).

[![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GdeX7cuWEAAXKXY?format=jpg&name=medium)](https://x.com/drawesomedoge/article/1862377110381502883/media/1862124018519642112)

## [](#p-67291-h-7-explorertoncoinorg-tons-first-blockchain-explorer-8)7\. [explorer.toncoin.org](http://explorer.toncoin.org): TON’s First Blockchain Explorer

The first blockchain explorer built into TON’s core codebase was incredibly fast but too technical for most users.

## [](#p-67291-h-8-tonsh-a-new-generation-explorer-9)8\. ton.sh: A New Generation Explorer

We created [ton.sh](http://ton.sh/) to address usability challenges. Key features included wallet balances, transactions, and memos.

* * *

## [](#p-67291-h-9-tonweb-the-essential-javascript-sdk-10)9\. TonWeb: The Essential JavaScript SDK

We developed **TonWeb**, a JavaScript SDK simplifying wallet creation, deployment, and transactions.

## [](#p-67291-recognition-newtons-open-letter-to-telegram-12)Recognition: NEWTON’s Open Letter to Telegram

By June 2021, the NEWTON team documented its contributions in an open letter ([TIP-33](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TIPs/issues/33)).  
To our surprise, [@Telegram](https://x.com/@Telegram)’s official team replied on June 30, 2021, marking the start of a new era.

I’ve witnessed every milestone - from early Bitcoin communities to exchange evolution, from Ethereum’s birth to TON & Telegram ecosystem growth, and now Bitcoin ETF approval.

With BTC reaching $100,000, I’m both grateful and amazed by how far we’ve come. Let me share this remarkable decade in Bitcoin. ![:writing_hand:t2:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/writing_hand/2.png?v=12 ":writing_hand:t2:")

* * *

## [](#p-67292-i-introduction-my-bitcoin-journey-2)I. Introduction: My Bitcoin Journey

In 2013, as a 20-year-old student, I was captivated by the emerging blockchain technology when I first encountered Bitcoin.

Many have asked why I haven’t achieved so-called financial freedom. Indeed, I met peers who took bold risks, even selling their homes to purchase Bitcoin at just $200. However, I lacked sufficient savings to invest and couldn’t fully grasp Bitcoin’s potential at the time. In 2014, I tried borrowing $3,000 from my parents to buy Bitcoin, but they refused.

Looking back, their decision might have been the right one—no one could foresee Bitcoin’s future. Perhaps it is this very uncertainty that makes Bitcoin such a challenging and fascinating asset.

In 2014, Bitcoin made headlines across Taiwan when its price surpassed $1,000 for the first time. My curiosity deepened after discussing this with my roommate. Though I initially understood the basics from Wikipedia, encouragement from my professor led me to explore Bitcoin’s technical aspects more deeply.

Beyond my studies, I joined Bitcoin communities on Facebook, where enthusiasts shared insights. I analyzed cryptocurrency exchanges like BTC-e, Poloniex, OKCoin, and Huobi, studying their operational logic. I also experimented with trading bots and arbitrage strategies, gaining firsthand experience of crypto market risks and challenges.

In 2014, I began serious academic research into Bitcoin’s technologies: decentralized networks, cryptographic hashing, and the Hashcash algorithm. This interdisciplinary exploration led me to Academia Sinica in 2015, where I studied the Tor network alongside Bitcoin.

Tor’s privacy mechanisms helped me understand Bitcoin’s pseudonymity and inspired new research questions about network security.

Simultaneously, I built the largest Chinese Bitcoin Community on Facebook, connected with industry pioneers, and attended early Bitcoin meetups. These gatherings provided invaluable insights and strengthened the community’s commitment to blockchain innovation.

[toots\_monkey](https://tonresear.ch/u/toots_monkey)  January 21, 2025, 10:23am  1

I was working on the recent TON context and encountered a roadblock. I synchronized the key blocks every 4 hours, but to confirm a block, I need to validate its signatures. I compiled the node IDs of the validators using their public keys and a predefined prefix, retrieved their weights, and attempted to validate the signatures to calculate the total weight to compare it with 2/3 total weight of all validators. However, I was surprised to discover that the verify\_signature function in FunC only supports 256-bit hashes, whereas the message I need to validate is 544 bits.

The problem is that I am not that quite understand your question tbh, but maybe you can check this: [ton/crypto/smartcont/stdlib.fc at 2a68c8610bf28b43b2019a479a70d0606c2a0aa1 · ton-blockchain/ton · GitHub](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/2a68c8610bf28b43b2019a479a70d0606c2a0aa1/crypto/smartcont/stdlib.fc#L173)

* * *

I tried to decode your idea here with ChatGPT but:

To solve this problem, I need to clarify a few things:

1.  **What is the exact structure of the 544-bit message that needs to be validated?**
    
    *   Is it a single block of data, or does it contain multiple parts that can be hashed separately?
2.  **What is the expected signature verification process in the TON blockchain for such messages?**
    
    *   Are there alternative methods in TON that handle signatures for messages longer than 256 bits?
3.  **Would hashing the 544-bit message down to 256 bits before verification be acceptable?**
    
    *   For example, using SHA-256 or another hashing method to generate a 256-bit digest and then verifying the signature against that.
4.  **Are there existing implementations or best practices in the TON ecosystem for verifying messages longer than 256 bits?**
    
    *   If so, should I focus on finding an existing approach or designing a new workaround?

Let me know these details, and I can provide a precise solution.

[Esteemedhuman](https://tonresear.ch/u/Esteemedhuman)   February 11, 2025, 12:12am  1

Have you ever felt embarrassed, cheated, or outsmarted? ![:sob:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/sob.png?v=12 ":sob:")![:sob:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/sob.png?v=12 ":sob:")![:sob:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/sob.png?v=12 ":sob:")

I know we’ve all experienced one or more of this as a fresher in a university or a newcomer in an unfamiliar environment.

As a university fresher, I got lost in my school building twice, relying on Google Maps as my lifesaver. I was also cheated by a bike man… If I continued sharing my struggles, this thread wouldn’t contain struggle I faced as a fresher.

[![Picsart_25-02-11_01-01-54-742](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/5/b/5b3a31e47bf448c725671aca5a81890ba59e8ade_2_600x500.jpeg)

However, I never realized how quickly I became familiar with my school until I encountered similar challenges in Web3. The struggles were the same, just disguised differently.

As I reflect on my experiences, I identify patterns of common challenges we all faced in an unfamiliar place, and also how I’ve solved them.

**1\. Lack of a Mentor or Guardian:**  
If I had a guardian who could have told me that the bike ride would cost 100 naira, I wouldn’t have lost an extra 400 naira to the bike man. Similarly, if I had a mentor when I first came into contact with Web3, I wouldn’t have lost $300 by holding onto a token when I should have taken profits.

**2\. Lack of Experience:**  
If you already have a guardian or mentor, gaining experience becomes much easier. Without one, you’re left to figure things out on your own, which often means getting lost, scammed, or wasting time before you can become smarter and more experienced.

**3\. Lack of Access to Relevant Information:**  
Another major problem is the difficulty in finding reliable information. This is where engagement and interaction come into play. By connecting with like-minded individuals, joining communities, and participating in Twitter Spaces, you can fast-track your learning and develop better techniques for gathering information.

This are the major problems I faced as a university freshman and a newbie in Web3

You can also add to the discussion by adding the problem in an unfamiliar place and how you’ve solved them

Nigeria’s crypto activity is largely driven by smaller retail and professional sized transactions.  
Transaction exceeding $1m account for 15% of the total value of cryptocurrency received in Nigeria, while the transaction under $1m account for the remainder 85%

𝐌𝐚𝐣𝐨𝐫 𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐨𝐧:

1.  Remittance fee: Many Nigerians rely on stablecoins to send money across borders due to the inefficiencies and high costs associated with traditional remittance channels. “Cross-border remittances are a major use case for stablecoins in Nigeria

As shown below, the average cost of sending a $200 remittance from Nigeria is approximately 60% lower when using stablecoins compared to traditional remittance methods facilitated by fiat currency.

2.  Inflation: As in other African countries, a major driver of stablecoin adoption in Nigeria is inflation and the depreciation of the naira — which plummeted to a record low in February 2024. We can see the impact of this trend by looking at transfer sizes under $1 million.

In Q1 2024, stablecoin value approached almost $3billion, making stablecoins the largest portion of sub-$1M transactions in Nigeria.  
Although bitcoin and altcoins remain relevant, representing billions in value received, stablecoins is clearly the favorite medium for transactions

3.  Influx of Youths Adoption: With the attraction of DeFi, Jobs offer, Airdrops. providing Nigerians with new opportunities to earn, receive incentives, and engage in decentralized trading, in addition to the traditional financial systems.

DeFi is experiencing a major moment in Nigeria, echoing  
the broader trend of Sub-Saharan Africa as the global leader in DeFi adoption. Nigeria stands at the  
forefront of this trend, with over $30 billion in value received in DeFi services last year.

𝐒𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬:

*   𝐆𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐎𝐩𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐨𝐧: While Nigeria is making progress with initiatives like ARIP, many FIs remain hesitant to fully engage with the crypto sector due to lingering regulatory ambiguities.

# [Race condition in FunC](/t/race-condition-in-func/40963)

[Application](/c/application/20) 

    

[BitByNIK](https://tonresear.ch/u/BitByNIK)  February 13, 2025, 4:54pm  1

Hi everyone,

I am new to TON Blockchain and FunC smart contract language.

I am trying to manifest a race condition using FunC as a part of my project. Below is the code →

```
#include "imports/stdlib.fc";


(int) load_data() inline {
    var ds = get_data().begin_parse();
    return (ds~load_uint(64));
}

() save_data(int counter) impure inline {
    set_data(begin_cell()
    .store_uint(counter, 64)
    .end_cell());
}

() recv_internal(int msg_value, cell in_msg, slice in_slice) impure {
    if(in_slice.slice_empty?()) {
        return ();
    } else {
        var counter = load_data();

        int i = 0;
        while(i < 5) {
            i += 1;
        }
        ;; send_raw_message(begin_cell().end_cell(), 64);

        counter += 1;
        save_data(counter);
    }
}

(int) get_counter() method_id {
    return load_data();
}
```

When writing tests, I am sending two internal messages. The final value of counter should be 1 after execution of both messages due to the race but it is actually 0. Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong and is race condition even possible in TON?

I have even tried to loop for more than 100000 times.

Здравствуйте!

Я разрабатываю биржу на базе TON и пытаюсь интегрировать обмен TON в актив FPIBANK с использованием SDK [STON.fi](http://STON.fi) (версии v2\_1). Я пробовал использовать адреса, указанные в документации, но при их использовании транзакции завершаются с ошибкой.

Подскажите, пожалуйста:

1.  Каковы актуальные адреса для pTON и Router для основной сети (mainnet)?
2.  Есть ли рекомендации по самостоятельному поиску этих адресов через TON-эксплореры или другие инструменты?

Заранее спасибо за помощь!

Hey TON Community!

Are you a proud owner of a .ton domain and looking to maximize its potential? Or are you simply curious about the exciting possibilities within the TON ecosystem? Then you’re in the right place!

Today, I want to introduce you to **dotTON**, a revolutionary platform built on the TON blockchain that’s designed to empower .ton domain owners like never before.

**What exactly is dotTON?**

Imagine turning your static .ton domain into a dynamic hub for content, services, and community. That’s precisely what dotTON does. It provides a suite of tools and services to:

*   **Effortlessly Create and Manage Subdomains:** Generate and configure subdomains (like `blog.yourdomain.ton`) with ease, offering a structured and versatile approach to your online presence and digital asset management. Think of it as building a digital real estate empire right on the TON blockchain! (For reference on how subdomains work within the TON DNS framework, check out the [Notion Wiki](https://www.notion.so/dotton/1a6f5e910fdb801581adfbdfa28eb49e?v=1a6f5e910fdb807ca6e1000c8af00ea7&pvs=4)
*   **Monetize Your Domains Through Subscriptions:** Implement subscription models to grant access to your subdomains, creating a sustainable income stream in TON.
*   **Offer Decentralized Services:** Leverage the security and transparency of the TON blockchain to provide reliable and trustworthy services to your users.

**Key Concepts to Understand:**

*   **.ton Domains:** These are your gateway to the decentralized web on TON. They’re human-readable, censorship-resistant, and managed directly on the blockchain, as detailed on [dns.ton.org](https://dns.ton.org).
*   **.ton Subdomains:** These are the building blocks within your domain, allowing you to create a hierarchical structure. They inherit the properties of your parent domain and operate seamlessly within the TON DNS framework.
*   **TON Blockchain:** The bedrock of dotTON, ensuring secure transactions, decentralized data storage, and the execution of smart contracts that power the platform’s features.

**Why dotTON Matters:**

In a rapidly evolving digital landscape, dotTON addresses the growing need for flexible and monetizable domain management within the TON ecosystem. It empowers you to:

*   **Enhance Domain Utility:** Transform your domain from a simple address to a dynamic platform for content, services, and community engagement.
*   **Generate Revenue:** Create sustainable income streams through subscription-based access to your subdomains.
*   **Foster Decentralization:** Contribute to the growth of the decentralized web by leveraging the power of the TON blockchain.

**What’s Next?**

In the upcoming discussions, we’ll dive deeper into:

*   The specific features and benefits of dotTON.
*   The intricacies of .ton domains and subdomains.
*   Practical use cases of dotTON.

I’m excited to explore the potential of dotTON with all of you. Let’s discuss how we can collectively build a more vibrant and decentralized TON ecosystem!

How and why does the community not accept new coins? I created coins for monetization of content, independent media, and music, cinema, made a description, but there is none,

To create a startup is not an easy thing, you need time as much as you need money, you might have a good vision, buh without knowledge, experience, patience, money  
ITS BOUND TO BE A FAILED VISION

A new member here. I personally tried to make some coins only for fun, which worked. It was like putting $50 for fun (like watching a movie, maybe?) and it is great.  
In order to make money by making coins or any other chain related project, you have to have a clean roadmap and business plan.

# [](#p-67831-stickers-1)一、 关于 Stickers

在日常聊天中，我们经常使用表情符号(Emoji)和贴图(Stickers), 其中 Emojo 本身是一个字符而不是图片，它可以嵌入到文字中间。比如这个**![:grinning:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/grinning.png?v=12 ":grinning:")**笑脸，它的 Emoji 字符是 `U+1F600`，不同的软件可以选择展示不同的小图片，在 Telegram 里面，你甚至可以自定义 Emoji 字符对应的小图片。

那贴图(Stickers)和我们直接在聊天框发送一个图片有什么区别和联系呢？可以理解为，贴图(Stickers)是对图片进行了标准化，比如要求 PNG 或 WEBP 格式，像素 512px 等等，从而给用户比较一致的体验，并且一组贴图可以打成一个包(pack)，Telegram 存储并生成唯一的链接方便传播和使用。更进一步，除了图片文件，Telegram 还支持将一些动画类型的文件制作成 贴图(Stickers)。

另外在创建贴图(Stickers)的时候，Telegram 会让你将 Emoji 和具体的贴图进行关联，从而可以输入 Emoji 的时候，自动关联一系列对应的贴图，方便快速输入贴图丰富聊天内容。

而 Gifts 是继贴图(Stickers)后 Telegram 对图片的一个新玩法，是在探索图片和社交功能上的又一次创新尝试。

    其实不仅仅是 Emoji ，你在电脑上看到的字母、汉字和标点符号本身，也都是 Unicode，操作系统决定了怎么展示这些符号。
