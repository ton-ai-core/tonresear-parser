Addickted \[$DICK\]

## [](#please-describe-your-project-and-token-utility-2)Please describe your project and token utility

Addickted.xyz ‚Äî antimemecoin on TON that heals your addicktion from masturbation to charts. 200k TON collected in 48 hours on a presale. We‚Äôve just listed on [DeDust.io](http://DeDust.io) on 22nd of April. There will be release of the launchpad to discover projects on TON and the game, where the token will be used.

Traction:

1.  N1 coin on TON ([https://dexscreener.com/ton](https://dexscreener.com/ton))
    
2.  $500k-$1m organic volume on one DEX (dedust)
    
3.  4.5k holders over one week

## [](#please-describe-your-project-roadmap-for-the-next-6-12-months-3)Please describe your project roadmap for the next 6-12 months

1.  Reach 300m cap (crazy for most of projects in TON)
    
2.  Have the most active and engaging community (200k+ holders)
    
3.  Addickted becomes cultural phenomenon (Not just DICK, think more of emotions in collecting baseball cards)
    
4.  Ecosystem of products that are loved by users in TON (and revenue generating)
    

What are we planning to do in order to achieve this:

1.  We are going to start with release of 2 products in May (game and laucnhpad). That will be engaging existing DICK holders, attracting new audience and generate revenue (which will be partially distributed to NFT holders and used to buy DICK back from exchanges). More products shortly after, we think during summer we will have around 4-5 ecosystem products in Addickted!
    
2.  We are attracting more global audience, just signed partnerships with KOLs and communities in India, Nigeria and North America (more to come). Their work will start already early next week.
    
3.  We hired amazing creative people in Addickted to generate content, partnerships (btw you will be surprised about porn actress) and a real identity of this cultural phenomenon.
    
4.  Listing on major CEX, we are in talks with 2 tier 1 exchanges and a few tier 2/3 excahnges. Here we really need your help as prerequisite to list on tier 1 exchanges is 30m + cap and active community. When it comes to listing on tier 2 or 3 exchanges, we can do it soon as they are ready to list, but we wanted to skip this step and go straigh to \*\*\* or \*\*\*\*\*, as it will give us even more community and exposure (what do you think? lets us know in comments)

Even before we started raising presale, our mission for addickted was longterm! (if we were short term, probably would not make 30k TON compensations, burn 2.5% of total supply and hire more than 10 people in last week). We wanted to build one of the main tokens/products in TON ecosystem!

By submitting the form I confirm that the data I provided is correct and I fully understand that in case of the contrary, my project will be permanently eliminated from The Open League.

The Tonutils Storage project represents an alternative implementation of TON storage using the `tonutils-go` library, focusing on providing an HTTP API for easier interaction. This initiative enhances the accessibility and usability of TON storage, opening new possibilities for developers and users in the TON ecosystem. Here are some professional insights and questions regarding this project:

### [](#professional-insights-1)Professional Insights:

1.  **Decentralization and Accessibility**: By offering an alternative storage solution on the TON blockchain, the project contributes to the decentralization ethos of blockchain technology. It provides users with more choices, potentially increasing the robustness and resilience of the TON storage ecosystem.
    
2.  **Ease of Use**: The introduction of an HTTP API simplifies interactions with the TON blockchain, making it more accessible to developers who might not be familiar with blockchain technologies. This could lead to increased adoption and innovative applications that leverage TON storage.
    
3.  **Open Source and Community Support**: The project‚Äôs open-source nature and the appeal for community support through donations suggest a commitment to transparency and community-driven development. This approach can foster a collaborative environment where improvements and new features are contributed by the community.
    
4.  **Technical Implementation**: The use of `tonutils-go` for the underlying implementation indicates a reliance on Go programming language‚Äôs efficiency and performance. Additionally, the provision of precompiled binaries for various platforms enhances the project‚Äôs accessibility to a wider audience.
    
5.  **Scalability and Minimum Requirements**: The outlined minimum requirements suggest that the storage solution is designed to be lightweight and accessible even to those with limited resources. However, scalability and performance in a production environment would be key considerations for widespread adoption.
    

### [](#professional-questions-2)Professional Questions:

1.  **Data Security and Privacy**: How does the project ensure the security and privacy of data stored using this alternative TON storage implementation? Are there any encryption mechanisms or privacy-preserving features integrated into the system?
    
2.  **Network Stability and Peering**: The project mentions that storage tries to resolve external IP addresses and that manual configuration might be necessary in some cases. How does this affect the network‚Äôs stability and the efficiency of data seeding and retrieval? What peering mechanisms are in place to ensure optimal data distribution?
    
3.  **Scalability**: As the number of users and the amount of data stored grows, how will the system scale to accommodate increased demand? Are there any built-in features or planned upgrades to address potential scalability issues?
    
4.  **Compatibility and Integration**: How compatible is this alternative storage solution with existing TON applications and smart contracts? Can developers seamlessly integrate it into their current projects, or are modifications required?
    
5.  **Governance and Development Roadmap**: What governance model does the project follow for decision-making and implementing new features? Is there a publicly available development roadmap outlining future upgrades and functionalities?
    

These insights and questions highlight the potential impact of the Tonutils Storage project on the TON ecosystem, as well as considerations for its future development and adoption.

I‚Äôm really excited to see the progress that $REGI has made over the past couple of months. My personal values, which include fighting against online censorship and advocating for internet freedom, align closely with this project. It also embodies what Telegram stands for, which is why they released the Resistance Girl as a native Telegram sticker pack.

Furthermore, I really like that it‚Äôs not just another dog or cat meme-based project; in fact, it‚Äôs the only female narrative project on the blockchain!

Beware of this scammers! Only 58% LP has been burnt and remaining 42% has been constantly dumped since 2M ATH, and the team thought they are smart by not sniping launch with wallets not linked to dev wallet but they caught with the source of deposit, we just checked and there‚Äôs multiple solana scams these guys did with the same method of just burning half the lp and pulling the remaining lp in a later stage.

would like to emphasize that If this REGI thing or anything deployed by this team ever gets accepted to the Open League, it would put a big shadow over Open League and the whole TON ecosystem. I‚Äôm a big supporter of TON myself and I would never want it to become scammer nest like SOLANA.

I am 100% confident you will perform a solid due diligence here.

 

[Epsten](https://tonresear.ch/u/Epsten)  May 10, 2024, 5:01am  6

To be honest, the REGI project they introduced with a Resistance theme is led by a group of serial scammers from a private Solana group. Their previous project is listed below called LARRY. If TON ever approves a project by this team, I‚Äôm confident the TON Foundation would regret choosing a project run by known scammers. They have half the liquidity pool unlocked, ready to execute a rug pull as soon as you list them.

On the liquidity point - since we had liquidity contest with solid prizes, big part of the liquidity is held by our community, so we don‚Äôt have any control over this part.

## [](#technical-specifications-2)Technical Specifications

The network operates on a decentralized model of payment nodes, which establish connections through smart contracts deployed on the blockchain and utilize the Reliable Datagram Protocol (RLDP) for network communication. These nodes serve dual purposes: as independent entities for transaction facilitation and as integrated libraries within applications for seamless service provision and payment functionalities, such as TON Storage and TON Proxy.

### [](#onchain-channels-3)Onchain Channels

Each node actively monitors blockchain transactions to detect updates related to its contracts, such as the establishment of new contracts or events signaling non-consensual closures. To initiate a connection, a node deploys a payment channel contract specifying both parties‚Äô public keys. Authentication over the network is secured through the exchange of messages signed with channel keys, ensuring integrity and confidentiality.

### [](#virtual-channels-4)Virtual Channels

Virtual channels allow transactions between any two network points via a chain of linked nodes, without requiring direct onchain contracts between every participant. These channels are characterized by their unique keys, lifespans, capacities, and fees. For instance, a virtual channel can be established from node `A` to `C` through `B`, leveraging existing onchain channels (`A->B`, `B->C`) for transaction routing. Security against potential breaches in the transaction chain is guaranteed through cryptographic mechanisms and the flexible architecture of the TON blockchain.

### [](#security-guarantees-5)Security Guarantees

Transactions within virtual channels occur off-chain, minimizing network fees and ensuring high-speed processing. In case of disputes, such as a node refusing to forward funds, the blockchain can be invoked to enforce the transaction based on provided proofs, ensuring risk mitigation.

### [](#virtual-channel-anonymity-6)Virtual Channel Anonymity

The chain‚Äôs initiator is the only entity aware of the entire node sequence, with each node only recognizing its immediate neighbors. This structure is achieved through ‚ÄúGarlic‚Äù packaging of tasks, where instructions are encrypted and decipherable only by the intended recipient, enhancing the network‚Äôs anonymity and security.

### [](#network-interactions-7)Network Interactions

The network‚Äôs protocol is built on two foundational actions: `ProposeAction` and `RequestAction`, ensuring transactional integrity and allowing for seamless operational flow between nodes. These actions facilitate the opening and closing of virtual channels, backed by a robust queue system that guarantees ACID compliance for all significant operations.

### [](#performance-reliability-and-cross-platform-compatibility-8)Performance, Reliability, and Cross-Platform Compatibility

The TON Payment Network boasts remarkable efficiency, with node operations taking mere milliseconds, allowing for high throughput of virtual channel management. Built on Go, the implementation ensures cross-platform compatibility, including mobile platforms, and leverages LevelDB for database management.

### [](#node-management-9)Node Management

Node operation is straightforward, with various console commands available for managing onchain and virtual channels, deploying contracts, and handling transactions. A publicly accessible node, identified by its public key `6504e4cffb6c13cabebbb6e33be9168a40900595ea1d88461733a9c8ae084232`, serves as a reference point for network interactions.

### [](#roadmap-10)Roadmap

Future developments include supporting transactions for users without an onchain wallet, MerkleProof-based virtual channels for scalability, and alternative database solutions like Postgres for enhanced data management.

## [](#conclusion-11)Conclusion

The TON Payment Network introduces a paradigm shift in digital transactions, offering unparalleled speed, security, and flexibility. By leveraging the TON Blockchain‚Äôs capabilities and innovative channel management, it promises to significantly enhance the efficiency and accessibility of peer-to-peer payments.

# [\[TEP-141\] Enhancing TON with Remote Onchain Execution: A Draft Proposal for Inter-Contract Communication](/t/tep-141-enhancing-ton-with-remote-onchain-execution-a-draft-proposal-for-inter-contract-communication/152)

[TON Blockchain](/c/ton-blockchain/17) 

    

[doge](https://tonresear.ch/u/doge)  February 3, 2024, 12:00pm  1

## [](#introduction-1)Introduction

The TON Blockchain, known for its advanced features and scalability, is poised to adopt a revolutionary method for inter-contract communication. This technical document outlines a proposal, identified as TEP 141, aiming to introduce a mechanism for contracts to execute code or read data from other contracts asynchronously. This capability addresses the current limitations in contract interactions and paves the way for more integrated and efficient decentralized applications.

## [](#tep-141-overview-2)TEP 141 Overview

*   **TEP Number**: 141
*   **Title**: Remote Onchain Execution
*   **Status**: Draft
*   **Type**: Core
*   **Authors**: [TEP Authors](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/pull/141)
*   **Created Date**: 20.01.2024

### [](#summary-3)Summary

TEP 141 proposes a novel approach allowing smart contracts on the TON Blockchain to perform remote executions on other contracts. This process, which encompasses both code execution and data reading, introduces asynchronous inter-contract interactions without the prerequisite for both parties to implement specific interfaces for communication.

### [](#motivation-4)Motivation

The current architecture of the TON Blockchain supports inter-contract communication only when both contracts are designed with the necessary interfaces. Additionally, the separation between contract-to-contract and contract-to-user interactions complicates the development process. TEP 141 aims to simplify these interactions, making the development of decentralized applications more streamlined and flexible.

### [](#specification-5)Specification

#### [](#introduction-of-new-internal-message-types-6)Introduction of New Internal Message Types

The proposal suggests extending the TON Blockchain‚Äôs messaging system to include new types of internal messages specifically designed for remote execution requests (RER) and their responses. This extension involves reallocating unused combinations of flags in the `CommonMsgInfo` structure to accommodate the new message types:

*   `int_msg_info_remote_execution`
*   `int_msg_info_remote_execution_response`

#### [](#remote-execution-request-process-7)Remote Execution Request Process

When an RER message reaches its destination, it triggers an execution process with several key differences from standard internal message processing:

1.  **Initialization**: The TVM initializes with the code and data from the RER‚Äôs state init, while also loading the destination contract‚Äôs code and data onto the stack.
2.  **Execution**: The execution of the destination smart contract occurs with the modified stack, allowing the RER to perform the desired operation.
3.  **Response Generation**: Instead of producing regular output actions, the TVM generates a single `int_msg_info_remote_execution_response` message containing the results of the execution.

### [](#drawbacks-8)Drawbacks

While TEP 141 introduces significant advantages, it also presents potential challenges:

1.  **Risk of Misuse**: The ability to rely on volatile data may lead developers to unintentionally create contracts that behave unpredictably, potentially leading to financial losses.
2.  **Increased Complexity**: The introduction of new internal message types adds complexity to the transaction execution process on the TON Blockchain.

### [](#rationale-and-alternatives-9)Rationale and Alternatives

The proposal restricts the ability to send messages from within an RER transaction to avoid complications in routing and guaranteeing logical timestamp (lt) order. This limitation ensures the integrity of the messaging system while facilitating the new functionality.

### [](#conclusion-10)Conclusion

TEP 141 represents a significant step forward in the evolution of the TON Blockchain, offering a method for contracts to interact more freely and efficiently. By addressing current limitations in contract communication, this proposal opens the door to more sophisticated and integrated decentralized applications. As the TON community considers this draft, the potential for remote onchain execution heralds a new era of blockchain development.

# [\[TEP-140\] Enhancing Smart Contract Flexibility with the Programmable Action Phase](/t/tep-140-enhancing-smart-contract-flexibility-with-the-programmable-action-phase/153)

[TON Blockchain](/c/ton-blockchain/17) 

[tep](https://tonresear.ch/tag/tep)

    

[doge](https://tonresear.ch/u/doge)  February 3, 2024, 12:04pm  1

## [](#introduction-1)Introduction

The **Programmable Action Phase** proposal, identified as TEP-140, introduces a significant upgrade to the execution model of smart contracts on the TON blockchain. By extending the capabilities of the Action Phase, this proposal aims to simplify contract logic and enhance the flexibility and predictability of contract actions post-computation.

## [](#motivation-2)Motivation

The need for the Programmable Action Phase arises from the limitations faced by smart contracts under the current TON execution model. Presently, smart contracts compose a sequence of actions during the Computation Phase, which are then executed in the Action Phase. This model, while effective, restricts the contract‚Äôs ability to adapt its behavior based on the success or failure of actions, particularly when managing TON balance for gas and message sending.

The introduction of conditional execution and logical operators within the Action Phase addresses this challenge, enabling more dynamic and efficient contract behavior and reducing the complexity of the Computation Phase.

## [](#proposal-overview-3)Proposal Overview

The proposal suggests the extension of the ‚Äúoutput actions‚Äù program, which currently functions as a sequential execution model, to include conditions and logical operators. This would transform the output actions into a richer, cycle-less program, enhancing the expressiveness and control flow of smart contract actions.

### [](#key-enhancements-4)Key Enhancements

*   **Logical Operators**: The inclusion of operators such as AND, XOR, and TRY-CATCH within the output actions enables conditional execution paths, allowing contracts to execute different sets of actions based on the outcomes of preceding actions.
*   **Conditional Execution**: By utilizing these operators, contracts can implement try-catch-else behavior, branching execution based on the success or failure of actions without the need for complex Computation Phase logic.
*   **TVM Level Access**: New op-codes will be introduced to facilitate the manipulation of the `c5` cell, enabling the assembly of complex action sequences through straightforward TVM instructions.

### [](#technical-specifications-5)Technical Specifications

The proposal outlines the addition of new action types to represent the logical operators:

*   **AND Operator**: Executes all actions from the first list, followed by all actions from the second list, propagating exceptions if any occur.
*   **XOR Operator**: Executes actions from both lists but throws an exception if both executions are successful, enforcing a mutually exclusive execution path.
*   **TRY-CATCH Operator**: Attempts to execute actions from the ‚Äútry list‚Äù and, upon failure, executes actions from the ‚Äúcatch list‚Äù.

These operators enhance the contract‚Äôs ability to dynamically respond to the outcomes of actions, paving the way for more resilient and adaptive smart contract designs.

## [](#drawbacks-and-considerations-6)Drawbacks and Considerations

While the Programmable Action Phase introduces significant advantages, it also complicates the execution model of the Action Phase and introduces challenges in analyzing and verifying the correctness of `c5` cell compositions. Furthermore, the proposal acknowledges the potential difficulty in parsing and presenting these extended actions in analytical tools, such as blockchain explorers.

## [](#conclusion-7)Conclusion

The Programmable Action Phase represents a pivotal development in the evolution of smart contract capabilities on the TON blockchain. By enabling conditional execution and logical operations within the Action Phase, this proposal addresses critical limitations of the current model, offering enhanced flexibility, efficiency, and simplicity in contract design. As the TON community deliberates on TEP-140, the potential for unlocking new use cases and improving contract behavior remains a compelling prospect for developers and users alike.

[tep](https://tonresear.ch/tag/tep)

    

[doge](https://tonresear.ch/u/doge)  February 3, 2024, 12:08pm  1

## [](#introduction-1)Introduction

The **Jetton Wallet Balance Query** proposal, identified as **TEP-137**, is a significant stride toward enhancing the functionality of Jetton wallets within the TON ecosystem. Spearheaded by Ken of Microcosm Labs, this proposal, currently in draft status, aims to introduce a mandatory onchain `get_balance` handler to standard Jetton wallets. This document outlines the motivation, specifications, and implications of adopting such a feature.

## [](#motivation-2)Motivation

The primary incentive behind this proposal is to enable smart contracts to query the balance of a Jetton wallet directly on the blockchain. This capability is particularly useful in scenarios where a smart contract needs to ascertain the minimum amount of Jetton tokens it holds, under the assurance that no outbound transfers will occur in the interim between the balance query and the response. This addition promises to streamline interactions and increase efficiency in smart contract operations.

## [](#implementation-guide-3)Implementation Guide

### [](#specification-overview-4)Specification Overview

Jetton wallets will need to accommodate a new message type, `get_balance#312493a5`, which requests the current balance. This message should carry a TON amount sufficient to cover the gas fees associated with processing and replying to the query, specifically more than 0.0061 TON under current basechain settings.

#### [](#response-handling-5)Response Handling

Upon receipt of a `get_balance` message that meets the gas fee requirement, the Jetton wallet is expected to reply with a `get_balance_response#41cb4e49`, detailing the wallet‚Äôs current balance. This response is critical for enabling smart contracts and other entities to make informed decisions based on the wallet‚Äôs token holdings.

### [](#existing-contracts-compatibility-6)Existing Contracts Compatibility

It‚Äôs noteworthy that existing Jetton contracts, developed prior to the introduction of this standard, will not support this new functionality. As such, new applications leveraging this feature must incorporate logic to handle both compliant and non-compliant Jetton contracts.

### [](#technical-details-7)Technical Details

The proposal specifies the TL-B Schema for the new messages, ensuring clarity and consistency in implementation. The precise formatting and tagging of these messages are delineated in the proposal document, providing a straightforward path for developers to integrate this functionality into new Jetton wallets.

## [](#drawbacks-and-considerations-8)Drawbacks and Considerations

Implementing this standard will necessitate adjustments in new applications to accommodate existing Jetton contracts that do not support onchain balance queries. Moreover, the introduction of this feature adds complexity to the Jetton wallet contract‚Äôs operation, a factor that developers must consider.

## [](#conclusion-9)Conclusion

**TEP-137** proposes a valuable enhancement to the Jetton wallet interface by enabling onchain balance queries. This feature aligns with token standards from other blockchain ecosystems and fills a functional gap in the TON ecosystem. While its adoption requires careful implementation to address compatibility with existing contracts, the benefits of increased operational clarity and efficiency are substantial. As the TON community continues to evolve, proposals like TEP-137 play a crucial role in expanding the blockchain‚Äôs capabilities and usability.

Is the monetary webApp game in the strategy genre with a social aspect, allowing participants to create and monetize their own world. The scarcity of plots for building cities will create focal points (centers) that attract user attention, increasing the income of cluster creators.

SAU tokens will be used to purchase plots, goods, and services in the virtual world.  
SAU will also be used to incentivize content creation and decision-making by users, thereby creating a decentralized virtual world.

The development of large proprietary platforms, such as Telegram, has enabled hundreds of millions of users to gather, interact, exchange content, and play games. Their network effects have helped create extensive online communities and gaming companies. These platforms control network rules and content flow, while generating significant revenue from communities and content creators who direct traffic to the platforms.

The Saudis TON aims to create a network that allows participants to own and receive full benefits from their contributions.

# [\[TEP-131\] Enhancing TON Transactions with Referral Codes in Query ID](/t/tep-131-enhancing-ton-transactions-with-referral-codes-in-query-id/155)

[TON Blockchain](/c/ton-blockchain/17) 

[tep](https://tonresear.ch/tag/tep)

    

[doge](https://tonresear.ch/u/doge)  February 3, 2024, 12:13pm  1

## [](#introduction-1)Introduction

The proposed TEP introduces a structured approach to utilizing the Query ID field in TON transactions, dividing it into two distinct parts: a referral code and an app-specific data segment. This structure aims to facilitate the implementation of referral and profit-sharing programs, as well as to improve the collection of usage statistics for applications on the TON network.

## [](#motivation-behind-the-proposal-2)Motivation Behind the Proposal

The primary motivation for this proposal is to standardize the way applications and services identify themselves when initiating transactions on the TON network. By allocating a portion of the Query ID for referral codes, apps can more easily participate in referral programs, attribute transactions to their origins, and gather valuable data on app usage. Additionally, this approach respects user privacy by allowing applications to opt-out of using referral codes, thereby catering to privacy-preserving applications and their users‚Äô expectations.

## [](#detailed-specification-3)Detailed Specification

The Query ID, traditionally a 64-bit field, is proposed to be divided as follows:

Segment

Bit Allocation

Purpose

Referral Code

First 32 bits

Identifies the author of the transaction, such as a dApp or wallet, distinguishing the application within the TON network.

App-Specific Data

Second 32 bits

Reserved for arbitrary use by the application, such as individual query identification in smart contracts, random nonces, or any other application-specific data.

This division allows applications to self-assign unique identifiers, facilitating easier identification and operation within the network‚Äôs ecosystem.

## [](#considerations-and-drawbacks-4)Considerations and Drawbacks

One of the main considerations of this proposal is the reduction of the identifier space for both the referral code and the app-specific data to 32 bits each. Applications requiring more extensive identifiers may need to utilize a portion of their allocated referral code space, potentially complicating the unique identification process.

## [](#rationale-and-alternatives-5)Rationale and Alternatives

The simplicity and straightforwardness of the proposed division make it an attractive option for application developers and service providers on the TON network. It enables easy integration of referral programs and efficient collection of usage statistics without significantly complicating the transaction initiation process. Alternatives might involve more complex encoding schemes or the use of additional metadata fields, potentially increasing the complexity and reducing the accessibility of such features.

## [](#conclusion-6)Conclusion

By structuring the Query ID to include both a referral code and app-specific data, the TEP aims to standardize application identification in TON transactions, enhancing the network‚Äôs functionality for developers and users alike. This proposal strikes a balance between usability, privacy, and the need for detailed transaction attribution, marking a step forward in the evolution of the TON blockchain‚Äôs capabilities.

Froge is a new ecosystem on the TON blockchain, capturing the most popular industries in cryptocurrency. The main focus is on DeFi and DEX. In addition to the decentralized finance aspect, the FrogeWallet wallet, FrogeLaunch launchpad and P2E project aggregator are in development.  
Our goal is to provide the most transparent project, built entirely together with the community using DAO elements.  
The Froge ecosystem provides many use cases for the user - from staking the native Froge token and providing liquidity to pools to participating in presales and participating in the development of P2E projects.  
To get a detailed look at the project, we suggest going to the website and looking at the white paper, where you can also find the road map.

[General](/c/general/4) 

    

[Nyackro](https://tonresear.ch/u/Nyackro)  May 1, 2024, 6:06pm  1

I present to you an incredible, huge, amazing project called ‚ÄúNyaCoin‚Äù and invite you to invest in this newest bankruptcy prospect. How does this coin differ from others and why should you invest in it?  
Oh well‚Ä¶ BECAUSE IT IS OWNED BY A DAMN PSYCHOPATH COSPLAYING BOGDANOF WITH HIS PUMP AND DUMP IT SCHEME, I HAVE A TON OF GENIUS JUST AMAZING IDEAS THAT WILL BLOW THE ROOF OF ANY INVESTOR, MY MAIN IDEA IS WHAT I WANT BURN 100% OF ALL NYACOINS AS SOON AS ITS TVL REACHES 1000 DOLLARS, CONSIDERING THAT AT 1000 DOLLARS TVL 20 MILLION NYACOIN COINS WILL BE USED, AND I HAVE 400,000 COINS POINTED INTO THE LIQUIDITY POOL (THOUGH I WILL PUT ANOTHER 300-400K THEN INTO THE POOL IF REALLY PEOPLE WOULD START PURCHASING AND WHO AM I? STUPID? WELL‚Ä¶ MAYBE, BUT I WOULD GO DOWN WITH MY SHIP IF IT‚ÄôS GONNA DROWN AND ASCEND IF IT‚ÄôS) IT TURN OUT THAT THE MOST PART OF ALL COINS RESIDING AFTER THIS APOCALYPSE WILL BE NOT WITH MY CREATOR, BUT WITH THE PEOPLE, JUST A MOST INCREDIBLE EXPERIMENT, I CAN‚ÄôT EVEN IMAGINE HOW THIS MAY INFLUENCE THE MARKET, BUT BEFORE I WILL BE BURNING 10% OF ALL NYACOINS EVERY DAY STARTING TOMORROW, I‚ÄôM TIRED OF WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO INVEST IN THIS COIN BECAUSE IT‚ÄôS EITHER ALL OR NOTHING, YOU HEAR ME PEOPLE, I‚ÄôLL BURN THEM, I‚ÄôLL BURN EVERYTHING OTHERS, HERE WHAT HAVE YOU DRIVED ME TO WITH YOUR IGNORING MY COIN SINCE ITS CREATION.  
Phew, okay‚Ä¶ If you‚Äôre interested and this post hasn‚Äôt been banned, then here‚Äôs a cart of this coin with 0 subscribers, I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm posting there for myself, some kind of schizoid: [https://https](https://https)://t.me/+G8GYUbwQPHE2OWIy  
In general, I just don‚Äôt know how else to attract attention to a no-name coin, I really wanted it to develop, but no one invested, so now it has become just a crazy experiment with crypto, I have never seen anyone burn so many coins, so I wonder what will happen, I don‚Äôt have the strength to develop this project for any long time. So if you are a risk-taker, then welcome to Nyacoin, the most controversial coin, what will happen after burning and counting all the coins left in a circulation? I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs obvious that the price will rise, but people will start withdrawing the coin and the price will start to fall, what the price will be, how much it will grow, what the future of the coin will be is unknown, but I would like to look at it, so I hope I‚Äôll get at least some attention, about the coin, i think it‚Äôs obvious, I revoked the right to edit, otherwise there was no point in such an experiment if it was possible to just print new coins lol.  
You can look at the tone of the minter for yourself at the coin address: EQAiX81ylxmJJ\_3miIkKBmOakWCX-HMS4hsP3ObwBFLxg4xH  
You can also check there that all the coins are really in my wallet, and it wasn‚Äôt me who was so cunning and secretive and sent everything to other accounts ahah, well, there are gone at most 20k coins, I don‚Äôt know where they are, I don‚Äôt remember why I sent them there, but another 10k each I sent it to my lads to buy an echpochmak or if the project REEEALLY GOING TO BLOW UP would buy a shawarma later on.  
And yes, to eliminate questions in the future, the ton minter platform actually allows you to burn all coins at once, which is actually shocking considering that if you don‚Äôt warn about this, it can lead to extremely unpredictable consequences, but someone will definitely lose money in this chaos, and someone will make money, kinda not fair (yeah, it‚Äôs me saying it lmao).  
Also i was wondering in telegram about what i will do if coin would get to 1000 dollars in like a day cause that‚Äôs would be boring to burn everything then right away, but i‚Äôm a man of a word, so i would do it if the community not gonna ask me do to otherwise, if it‚Äôs really gonna escalate fast i‚Äôll do a poll in a telegram asking you guys about what to do, burn or wait.  
Well, okay, that‚Äôs all, follow the news in the telegram, write, comment, it‚Äôs interesting to know what you think about this coin, is this idea doomed to failure or is it still a really interesting investment?  
And yeah, this post was translated mostly with google cause i‚Äôm too lazy to translate it myself lol.  
Oh, yeah, i forgot, here‚Äôs a link to a coin: [STON.fi](https://app.ston.fi/pools/EQAu7AQBz7XNShyYLJRWNxgcKmU7wDkFaZaghuiCGnaqgnZg) (hope that it would work cause telegram users said they were having problems accessing it)

# [\[TEP-130\] Optimizing Token Mechanics: Introducing the Rebase Jetton Standard](/t/tep-130-optimizing-token-mechanics-introducing-the-rebase-jetton-standard/156)

[Application](/c/application/jetton/26)  [Jetton](/c/application/jetton/26) 

[tep](https://tonresear.ch/tag/tep)

    

[doge](https://tonresear.ch/u/doge)  February 3, 2024, 12:19pm  1

The Rebase Jetton Standard proposes a novel interface for rebase tokens within the TON Blockchain ecosystem, addressing the inherent limitations of the Jetton architecture in supporting dynamic balance adjustments. This document outlines the motivation, technical specifications, and integration guidelines for the Rebase Jetton standard, aiming to streamline the implementation of rebase tokens and enhance network efficiency.

## [](#summary-1)Summary

The Rebase Jetton Standard delineates a structured approach for rebase tokens, where a user‚Äôs balance is dynamically calculated based on their share of the total supply. This is crucial for the implementation of tokens whose balances can adjust over time without necessitating direct transactions, thus mitigating network fee implications.

## [](#motivation-2)Motivation

Traditional Jetton architecture does not accommodate rebase tokens due to the separation of balance and share management across Jetton-master and Jetton-wallet contracts. The Rebase Jetton standard circumvents this limitation by facilitating balance computation through shared ownership, reducing the network‚Äôs operational costs.

## [](#specification-3)Specification

The specification includes detailed descriptions of the contract interfaces, message schemas (TL-B), and operational guidelines necessary for implementing rebase jettons, ensuring compatibility and operational efficiency within the TON ecosystem.

### [](#comparison-of-traditional-vs-rebase-jetton-architecture-4)Comparison of Traditional vs. Rebase Jetton Architecture

Feature

Traditional Jetton Architecture

Rebase Jetton Standard

Balance Calculation

Direct balance management

Balance derived from share of total supply

Contract Structure

Separate master and wallet contracts

Master contract and decentralized wallet contracts

Network Fee Efficiency

High for dynamic balance adjustments

Low due to reduced transaction requirements for rebasing

Compatibility

With Jetton protocol

Specific to rebase mechanics, not directly compatible

## [](#implementation-guide-5)Implementation Guide

### [](#frontend-integration-6)Frontend Integration

Frontend applications must adapt to accurately reflect rebase jetton balances, requiring the retrieval of share data from individual wallets and corresponding balance calculations through the master contract.

### [](#smart-contract-details-7)Smart Contract Details

*   Handles internal message transactions for transfer and burn operations, adhering to specific schemas and operational logic.

#### [](#rebase-jetton-master-9)Rebase Jetton Master

*   Central contract for minting new jettons and managing total supply and shares.
*   Provides utility methods for wallet address retrieval, balance, and share calculations.

## [](#challenges-and-considerations-10)Challenges and Considerations

The document highlights potential drawbacks, such as the inability to ascertain real-time balances on-chain and the vulnerabilities associated with share-based systems. It also discusses alternatives, rationale, and unresolved questions regarding safe transfers and backward compatibility.

## [](#conclusion-11)Conclusion

The Rebase Jetton Standard represents a significant advancement in the implementation of rebase tokens on the TON Blockchain. By providing a comprehensive framework for their creation and management, it facilitates the development of innovative financial instruments and applications.

# [\[TEP-129\] Implementing the Destroyable NFT Standard on TON Blockchain](/t/tep-129-implementing-the-destroyable-nft-standard-on-ton-blockchain/157)

[Application](/c/application/nft/28)  [NFT](/c/application/nft/28) 

[tep](https://tonresear.ch/tag/tep)

    

[doge](https://tonresear.ch/u/doge)  February 3, 2024, 12:29pm  1

The proposed Destroyable NFT Standard introduces an enhancement to the existing [NFT Standard](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md), enabling the destruction of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in a way that renders them as if they were never minted. This document provides a technical specification for the standard, including its motivation, implementation details, and the benefits it offers to the TON blockchain ecosystem.

#### [](#motivation-1)Motivation

The need for a Destroyable NFT Standard arises from the limitations faced by NFT owners who wish to permanently remove an NFT from their possession without transferring it to another party. Current practices, such as sending the NFT to a zero address, result in unnecessary gas fees and do not effectively remove the NFT from the circulating supply as perceived by indexers. This standard offers a solution by allowing for the complete destruction of an NFT, addressing both economic and technical inefficiencies.

#### [](#specification-2)Specification

The Destroyable NFT Standard builds upon the [NFT Standard](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md) by introducing a `destroy` operation. This operation enables the removal of an NFT from the blockchain, ensuring that it cannot be reminted or transferred, thereby simulating its non-existence.

**Technical Details:**

Operation

TL-B Schema

Description

`destroy`

`destroy#1f04537a query_id:uint64 = InternalMsgBody;`

Initiates the destruction of an NFT.

*   **Conditions for Rejection:** The operation is rejected if the request does not originate from the NFT‚Äôs owner.
*   **Effects of Destruction:** Upon successful execution, the NFT‚Äôs ownership, content, and collection linkage are nullified. A confirmation message with the schema `excesses#d53276db query_id:uint64 = InternalMsgBody;` is sent to the requester, transferring any remaining contract balance.

**Implementation Example:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ArkadiyStena/nft-destroyable/blob/master/nft-destroyable.fc)

#### [](#guide-3)Guide

The process for minting and interacting with destroyable NFTs remains consistent with that of standard NFTs, with the addition of the `destroy` operation for permanently removing an NFT from circulation.

#### [](#drawbacks-4)Drawbacks

The primary limitation of this standard is the irretrievable loss of NFT content following destruction, which may not be suitable for all use cases.

#### [](#rationale-and-alternatives-5)Rationale and Alternatives

The Destroyable NFT Standard is designed to offer a comprehensive solution for the permanent removal of NFTs, addressing both user and creator needs. Alternatives considered included treating NFTs sent to a zero address as burned, but this approach failed to resolve the issues identified in the motivation for this standard.

#### [](#conclusion-6)Conclusion

The introduction of the Destroyable NFT Standard represents a significant advancement for the TON blockchain ecosystem, providing a mechanism for the efficient and permanent removal of NFTs. This standard not only enhances the user experience by eliminating unwanted NFTs but also ensures the integrity of NFT collections by preventing the reminting of destroyed tokens.

\# Summary Extension for \[NFT Standard\](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs[‚Ä¶](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/pull/129)/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md). A standard interface for non-fungible tokens which allow to destroy them similar to \[SBTs\] (https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0085-sbt-standard.md#3-destroy). Destroyed NFTs looks like they were never minted, and there is no possibility to re-mint them # Motivation Sometimes people want to get rid of an NFT in their wallet, but don't want to sell or gift it to anyone (for example, if the creator of NFT collection accidentally minted an extra NFT), and the only thing they can do is to send the NFT to a zero address. However, this solution has two problems: \* Sending an NFT to a zero address is a loss for the user (a gas fee must be paid and the balance of the NFT smart contract cannot be withdrawn). \* Indexers will continue to display this NFT as if it belongs to some user, which means the displayed supply of the NFT collection could be reduced, even though no actions can be performed with this NFT anymore.

## [](#introduction-1)Introduction

The Compressed NFT Standard proposal, identified as TEP-0, aims to introduce a novel approach to the creation and management of Non-Fungible Token (NFT) collections on the blockchain. Authored by Maxim Gromov, Narek Abovyan, Ivan Nedzvetsky, and Daniil Sedov, this draft standard proposes a mechanism for the efficient, cost-effective mass creation of NFT items. Dated 28th July 2023, the standard seeks to extend the existing NFT Standard by leveraging data compression techniques, specifically through the use of Merkle trees, to significantly reduce the costs associated with the creation of large volumes of NFTs. This document outlines the key components, motivations, and technical specifications of the proposed standard.

## [](#motivation-3)Motivation

The need for a cost-effective method to create large volumes of NFTs is driven by the desire for expansive community engagement and large-scale advertising campaigns. Traditional NFT creation methods, which often incur linearly scaling costs with the number of NFTs minted, pose significant barriers to these objectives. The proposed standard addresses this challenge by introducing a method that allows for the mass creation of NFT items at a substantially lower cost.

## [](#guide-and-specification-4)Guide and Specification

The core of the proposed solution lies in the utilization of Merkle trees. This approach enables the representation of an entire collection of NFT items with a single hash, drastically reducing storage and transaction costs. Each NFT item, represented as a leaf in the Merkle tree, can be claimed by providing a proof of its existence within the tree, thus eliminating the need for individual storage of each item on the blockchain.

### [](#key-components-5)Key Components

*   **Item Data**: Includes metadata specifying the owner and individual content of each NFT item, along with a unique index.
*   **Contract**: Outlines the mandatory implementation of get-methods and internal messages within the NFT Collection smart contract to support the claiming process and interaction with the augmenting API.
*   **Augmenting API Version 1**: Provides a detailed description of API endpoints that facilitate the retrieval of item information, including the necessary proof for claiming NFTs.

## [](#comparison-with-existing-solutions-6)Comparison with Existing Solutions

Feature

Compressed NFT Standard

Traditional NFT Standards

**Cost Efficiency**

High efficiency through batch creation

Lower efficiency, costs scale with item numbers

**Data Storage**

Single hash for entire collection

Individual storage per item

**Creation Process**

Items are ‚Äúvirtually‚Äù created and claimed later

Items minted upon creation

**Technical Implementation**

Utilizes Merkle trees for data compression

Typically relies on straightforward minting

**User Involvement in Minting**

End-users bear the minting costs upon claiming

Creator incurs all minting costs upfront

## [](#drawbacks-and-future-possibilities-7)Drawbacks and Future Possibilities

While the Compressed NFT Standard introduces significant cost savings and efficiency improvements, it also centralizes the augmenting API and requires items to be claimed before they are represented on-chain. Future developments could explore the potential for reducing costs further through the use of TVM-native merkle proof cells, despite current limitations in wallet support for special/exotic Cells.

## [](#conclusion-8)Conclusion

The Compressed NFT Standard proposes a transformative approach to the creation and management of NFT collections, offering a scalable, cost-effective solution for mass NFT production. By addressing the limitations of existing standards, this draft sets the stage for broader adoption and innovative applications of NFT technology in community building and marketing campaigns.

_Imagine a token where 600m people recognise it before it goes viral‚Ä¶_

_Now imagine those 600m people already use the platform that helped design the blockchain it lives on‚Ä¶_

_That‚Äôs right - Rosecoin is here_

Listing in late March, Rosecoin has become one of the strongest memecoins on the Ton blockchain. Launched on DeDust, initial liquidity was burnt and mint revoked. The original developer left the project early and a team of believers took over and have assumed control of it along with the community.

Rose is a face recognised by every crypto enthusiast trading in the defi space on Telegram. With ready access to a huge user base and the free viral marketing reach of her presence in over 12 million Telegram groups, Rose stands out as well known meme. With the huge traction that Ton is receiving from Telegram users and Venture capital funds alike, Rosecoin will capitalise on the surge in Ton volume to become the obvious choice for Ton investors.

‚Äì A Visionary Crypto Endeavor, RoseCoin is designed as a tribute to the Most used bot in telegram Rose bot with 600M active user. While not officially linked to Rose bot, RoseCoin celebrates the spirit of community and technological contribution in the crypto world.

‚Äì About RoseCoin - RoseCoin finds its home on the TON blockchain, a platform backed by Telegram, enhancing the legacy of Miss Rose, the beloved unofficial mascot for crypto enthusiasts. RoseCoin embodies dedication and companionship, symbolizing steadfast support through the volatile crypto journey.

![:white_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:") Milestones and Roadmap RoseCoin‚Äôs roadmap showcases clear milestones aimed at building a robust community and ensuring continuous support for the Rose bot. Initiatives include enhancing its presence on social platforms, expanding its holder base, and launching innovative NFTs to support both the Rose bot and marketing efforts.

‚Äì Building a Legacy With a focus on growth and community engagement, RoseCoin is more than just a cryptocurrency‚Äîit‚Äôs a commitment to supporting and advancing the crypto community, ensuring the enduring legacy of helpful bots like Rose.

**Roadmap**

Over the next 12 months, we aim to gain a stronghold in the Ton memecoin space through targeted marketing endeavours and partnering with well-known Ton influencers. An NFT collection is already in progress but yet to be released - we want the NFTs to have value for minters and will strategically roll them out when we are confident they will mint out.

Our short term goal is to reach 1-2k holders and over 1000 active members in our Telegram - we currently have an 85% TG member to holder ratio, which is evidentiary of how strong and engaged the community is. We are also in the process of a rebrand, our strong position in the market means we have outgrown the initial social development and are looking to rebuild it from the ground up to create a strong brand.

As one of the few Ton projects listed as fully tracked on Coinmarketcap, our next goal is to be listed on Coingecko. Our marketing efforts have mainly so far focused on running ads on several platforms such as Reddit, Dexscreener and Geckoterminal. We have made no paid influencer marketing and our growth so far has been through organic means as we strive to build a strong community and avoid the volatility seen in other projects.

We currently boast over 600 holders, a market cap floor of around $1m and an extra 30% liquidity added to the pool by the team and community members.

We welcome everyone to come and view our community, check out our socials and ask any questions you may have.

Resharing a comment I said about Rose earlier,

It‚Äôs not only the narrative, vision, and clear goals laid out to tackle ahead‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a coin I really feel has united people in a truly genuine sense.

‚Äú When you realize your long-term play is not unique but shared amongst legitimate builders‚Ä¶

and every single person, from the whales down to the $20 bags of Rose know exactly where she belongs

That‚Äôs when web3 gets fun‚Ä¶ bc you know everyone will send it hard asf. Through market blood, fud, lack of trust in your fellow holders keeping the chart steady, it‚Äôs honestly just overall positive, even with other coins coming in to play.

The community is both serious and the most based I‚Äôve seen. Working together to help pay homege to the very same bot that literally introduced us on Telegram (the very same L1 blockchain we‚Äôre excited about) is bullish to me

Great post.

# [\[TEP-122\] Enhancing NFTs with Onchain Reveal Mechanics: A Draft Standard for Transparent Content Updates](/t/tep-122-enhancing-nfts-with-onchain-reveal-mechanics-a-draft-standard-for-transparent-content-updates/159)

## [](#introduction-1)Introduction

In the evolving landscape of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), the demand for innovative features that enhance user engagement and trust is ever-increasing. This document introduces a draft standard, identified as TEP-0, proposed by Andrey Tvorozhkov, which aims to extend the NFT standard with onchain reveal mechanics. The proposed standard, marked as a draft and created on 31st October 2022, seeks to provide a transparent and fair method for revealing the contents of distributed NFTs, addressing the common concerns associated with the integrity of the reveal process in NFT collections.

## [](#motivation-3)Motivation

The proposal is motivated by the need for a transparent and fair mechanism to reveal the contents of NFTs post-distribution. Traditional methods, which rely on external messages for content updates, lack transparency and can undermine trust among users. By enabling onchain reveal mechanics, the standard aims to ensure fairness in the distribution of NFT contents, thus fostering greater confidence in the process.

## [](#specification-highlights-4)Specification Highlights

The standard introduces specific enhancements to both the NFT collection and individual NFT items to support onchain reveals:

### [](#collection-side-enhancements-5)Collection Side Enhancements

*   **New GET Method (`get_reveal_data`)**: Allows retrieval of information about the remaining NFT content available for reveal.
*   **Internal Message Extensions**: Include `nft_reveal_nft_request`, `nft_reveal_success_collection_response`, and `collection_add_reveal_batch` for managing the reveal process and content pool.

### [](#nft-side-enhancements-6)NFT Side Enhancements

*   **New GET Method (`get_reveal_mode`)**: Indicates the current reveal status of the NFT item.
*   **Internal Message Extension (`nft_reveal_user_request`)**: Enables users to initiate a reveal request for their NFT item.

## [](#comparison-with-existing-solutions-7)Comparison with Existing Solutions

Feature

Onchain Reveal Mechanic

Traditional Reveal Methods

**Transparency**

High, due to onchain mechanics

Low, often opaque due to backend processes

**User Trust**

Enhanced by transparent processes

Potentially compromised without transparency

**Implementation**

Requires specific smart contract extensions

Relies on external messages and backend updates

**User Engagement**

Potentially higher due to interactive reveals

Passive, with limited user interaction

**Flexibility**

Standardized for ease of use across applications

Varies widely, often custom to each collection

## [](#drawbacks-8)Drawbacks

The proposal acknowledges potential challenges, including the complexity of implementing onchain reveal mechanisms and the need for adherence to the proposed standard for effective interoperability.

## [](#rationale-and-alternatives-9)Rationale and Alternatives

The onchain reveal mechanic is presented as the optimal solution for enhancing transparency and trust in NFT reveals. Alternatives considered include off-chain solutions, which lack the transparency and trustworthiness that onchain processes can provide. The decision to focus on onchain mechanisms stems from the desire to standardize the reveal process, making it more accessible and reliable for developers and users alike.

## [](#conclusion-10)Conclusion

The Onchain Reveal Mechanic standard represents a significant step forward in the quest for transparency and fairness in the NFT space. By providing a standardized, transparent method for revealing NFT contents, the proposal addresses key concerns related to trust and engagement in NFT collections. As the standard moves from draft to implementation, it has the potential to reshape how NFT reveals are conducted, offering a more interactive and trustworthy experience for users across the blockchain ecosystem.

By adding TON, accessibility to millions of Telegram users, competitive elements, and modern ideas, TONmap aims to create a lasting impact and offer the opportunity to mine a meme coin.

Each pixel on the TONmap canvas is priced at 1 TON and comes with coordinates, a sequential number, an image, a description, and the owner‚Äôs wallet or Telegram username. This allows users to customize their display and showcase their territory on the main TON/Telegram map.

The project serves as a vast advertising platform for projects and individuals in the TON and Telegram ecosystems, offering continuous advertisement on the website, map, and mini-app. It follows the legacy of [milliondollarhomepage.com](http://milliondollarhomepage.com) while embedding itself in the history of blockchain.

![:heavy_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/heavy_check_mark.png?v=12 ":heavy_check_mark:") Each pixel, besides being priced at 1 TON, has coordinates (999x999), a sequential number (0 - 999 999), an image, a description, the wallet or Telegram username of the owner, and a link. All of this is publicly accessible on the map to every visitor. You can customize what to display.

![:heavy_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/heavy_check_mark.png?v=12 ":heavy_check_mark:") The buying process is extremely simple. Connect your wallet => Buy button => Select one or multiple pixels => Confirm the transaction.

![:heavy_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/heavy_check_mark.png?v=12 ":heavy_check_mark:") Now, on the main TON/Telegram map, you have your place, your land, your advertising space, and a place for self-expression. And, of course, access to the full functionality of our Mini-app in Telegram.

![:heavy_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/heavy_check_mark.png?v=12 ":heavy_check_mark:") Everyone will have the opportunity to showcase their territories, the most exquisite and rare pixels, and simply the status of the most successful NFT owner on TON.

The conceptual aspects of the project:

*   A vast advertising platform for projects and people in TON and Telegram (advertisement on the website, on the map, in the mini-app, continuously, for years).
*   A significant experiment; owning a pixel is prestigious. You can receive discounts on goods and bonuses from partners.
*   Embed yourself in the history of blockchain.
*   Your personal corner/metaverse in TON.
*   You can buy now, and sell later with conversion to NFT.
*   Every pixel owner will be able to mine a coin within the application with bonuses.
*   Bridge to onboard TON users on Near through Punks

### [](#mission-10)Mission.

The mission of TONmap is to provide users with a massive advertising platform, leaving a lasting mark in history for both the project and each user, while spreading TON to the masses.

The project engages users through various activities such as referral programs, coin claims, completing tasks, boosting cities, and renting out pixels.

### [](#activity-11)Activity.

*   Referral for coins, which can be exchanged for TON (10%).
*   Coin claims once every N hours, which will receive liquidity from TON staking and USDT.
*   Completing tasks for coins.
*   Boosting cities (channels) and their movement to the top.
*   Renting out your pixels.
*   Other activities under development.

### [](#tokenomics-12)Tokenomics

Tokenomics involve coin farming, voting for denominations, and token rollout, with a portion of the funds allocated to staking mechanisms. At least 50% of the proceeds from pixel sales will be invested back into the ecosystem.

The plan is to release approximately 50,000 - 100,000 TON for token liquidity (assuming all pixels are sold). Additionally, a significant portion of the funds will be allocated to various staking mechanisms to ensure a consistent flow of funds into token liquidity and project development.

Target audience: Telegram and TON users, who want to advertise their project on the canvas, or inscribe themselves into history

The address belongs to RECA team, easiest proof of that is their recent relock of RECA liquidity on Ton INU from the same address.

3.  **They claim in the application and in the thread here that team only owns 1% supply (after selling 45k USD on the market), which fully contradicts with their 150k USD buybacks statement.**

I attached some links, but I‚Äôm pretty sure you know better than me how to verify claims above on the blockchain. I‚Äôm linking these just so you spend less time on your research. Make sure you perform a very detailed due diligence before you add shady projects like RECA to the Open League.

Clearly its REGI team whos been making false accusation since 500k lmao.

Tremp lp was extended to 6months already and they added 12000$ worth more lp aswell. And after that 40k dump, team literally made around 100k worth of ton buybacks and that‚Äôs why its still in the top gainers and even today.

You guys can try hard, cry hard but that doesn‚Äôt gonna help your project. 0iqd selfish bitches should be exposed

 

[Epsten](https://tonresear.ch/u/Epsten) May 9, 2024, 1:32pm  11

Probably this was the guy sold 4k worth of his tokens at 600k bottom

1.  team clearly said that their teammate who was assisting them since launch sold his 2% allocation,this happened at 1m and team bought back around 2x of what the teammate sold and he got kicked out of the team already
    
2.  no one lost in tremp, they launchd it with 0 team allocations, lp lock got expired and theyy relocked it for 6more months with 12k more liquidity for CTO to happen
    
3.  projects like ResistanceGirl and spotty couldnt bear reca‚Äôs success and been constantly fudding like a clown despite RECA‚Äôs huge success over the past few days.
    

Better than spending time here to destroy a project, instead use it to grow your own project, kiddo

You posted the transaction they sold. But why didn‚Äôt you mention any transaction where they bought back and burnt tokens? They‚Äôve been consistently buying back tokens since the incident occurred. For example, in this wallet : [Transaction ¬∑ 82ca‚Ä¶3425](https://tonviewer.com/transaction/82ca843b234b4c673e708e3483275233b69eeb7d79515026ed3579810b7e3425)  
they bought nearly 30,000 worth of tokens and burnt 7000 worth tokens and allocated remaining for oyster labs partnership

So far, if we connect the dots, they‚Äôve purchased around $150,000 worth of RECA tokens and already burnt $7,000. Your post doesn‚Äôt add up; it just seems like a desperate attempt from a competing project. ![:man_shrugging:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/man_shrugging.png?v=12 ":man_shrugging:") Not sure why there are individuals here trying to tear down a project while they can be doing something productive.

![:slight_smile:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12 ":slight_smile:") o you are saying that they sold 40k at 1M, still people buying and now its around 2.6M, watch their progress man and in private chat they already resolved this thing about 40k sell. Not sure why you are angry with them, but just join their telegram and see how hard they work. Maybe you sold too early? No worries just DCA from here, the ton chain is still super early. Buy projects with solid teams like $JDOGE $FISH and RECA.. From what i have seen from the links that you sent, yes its connected with the dev wallet but they made more dollars Buybacks than the dumped money, so I don't find something bearish here.. They been rewarding daily atleast 50 for shillers, doing giveaways, giving ton frequently for those active guys in chat etc. Its hard, but yeah you can still make money of the chain, don‚Äôt worry ![:slight_smile:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12 ":slight_smile:")

Not sure why you decided to comeup with this right at the moment of us getting listed on the minor league , but all good. We have been transparent with our community, most of them know about how much was sold by one of our teammate and how much we bought back later to rectify the mistake happened from our side.  
The team member who dumped his allocation has Been kicked out already and replaced by a reputable guy in the space. This is an completely anon space and he has been working with us since 2021, never thought he would completely dump his allocation this early, not sure how we could have stopped this from happening. We fixed it by buying back around 2x of what he sold. Only 0.8% team allocation for three more members are left and they been already locked for 6months on tonraffles.

Look man, you registered 4th alt account already and still haven‚Äôt posted anything that would deny my claims above.

You can do as many buybacks as you want with the money scammed from other projects including tremp on TON, it would not help you bleach your reputation. It‚Äôs good that you‚Äôre putting this money into TON instead of buying lambos like other scammers do, but how long can this last?

Its funny that you put a tweet only after you were exposed, proving that you were indeed guilty and not transparent at all. What about tremp though, are you going to make a post about this as well now that everyone knows the truth?

[@openleaguesupport](/u/openleaguesupport) I would like to emphasize that If this RECA thing or anything deployed by this team ever gets accepted to the Open League, it would put a big shadow over Open League and the whole TON ecosystem. I‚Äôm a big supporter of TON myself and I would never want it to become scammer nest like SOLANA.

I am 100% confident you will perform a solid due diligence here.

**Welcome to the WEB3 Entertainment World of the Billion Gems!**

## [](#h-2)

![:gem:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/gem.png?v=12 ":gem:") **What is The Billion Gems?**

**Billion Gems** is the ‚Ññ1 WEB3 Entertainment World on Telegram, where you can create and promote your profile in various rating categories, receive donations, create NFT collections, build teams, farm coins, and compete with opponents in Battle Games. We are building a large project community, investment tools on the TON Blockchain, establishing transparent monetization, and engaging gameplay mechanics to ensure that games and the entertainment segment bring not only joy but also benefits to all holders of the $BLN token.

Our group of companies has been developing Fintech and GameFi products for over 10 years. Our portfolio includes FinTech products and dozens of exciting games with a million-strong audience. We believe in TON as much as we once believed in BTC and have been successfully investing in it since 2012, so we will make a significant contribution to the development of the TON Blockchain.

## [](#h-5)

**Phase ‚Ññ1**

## [](#h-6)

![:trophy:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/trophy.png?v=12 ":trophy:") **Billion Mania**

![:trophy:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/trophy.png?v=12 ":trophy:") **Billion Mania** is the first WEB3 Race for Hype in the World on The TON Blockchain, in which all people on our Planet can take part. Who will be the most popular? Or the richest in the World? Who will come out on top? Maybe Elon Musk, Drake, Morgenshtern, Mellstroy or you? ![:thinking:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/thinking.png?v=12 ":thinking:")

You will be able to compete on a par with popular bloggers, streamers, artists, stand-up comedians, businessmen and popular projects. Promote yourself, your business, startups, blogs, music, films, videos in the Billionverse.

One Million people and projects will go down in history, leaving their mark on the Billionverse crypto space!

This will be a historic moment for everyone who uses cryptocurrencies, and especially for the development of the TON Blockchain ecosystem.

**Billion Mania** is a community project - a project that will become the foundation in the infrastructure of our future projects.

With Billion Mania, we will create **Billionverse** within our entertaining WEB3 World of Billion Gems.

### [](#h-7)

![:white_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:") **Our goals**

![:white_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:") **Our main goal** is not only to attract the maximum audience to our project but also to enable TON Blockchain to attract the attention of even more new investors beyond Telegram and the TON ecosystem. In our plans, we aim to develop not only entertaining and competitive content within the Billion Gems project but also to implement additional projects to scale the TON ecosystem.

We have all the resources and knowledge for this.

### [](#h-8)

![:star:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/star.png?v=12 ":star:") **Unique approach**

![:thinking:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/thinking.png?v=12 ":thinking:") **What is our unique approach?**

In Billion Gems, there‚Äôs no need to rush and form teams right away‚Ä¶ First of all we‚Äôll create value and a community, then we‚Äôll provide infrastructure with maximum distribution.

Thanks to our unique approach, the **Billion Gems Coin ($BLN)** will be one of the most decentralized and distributed tokens on the TON Blockchain. We could have gone the traditional route and done a Fairlaunch, but we want to demonstrate that a project should first learn to earn and showcase a transparent financial model, and secondly, it should protect its investors and holders by having liquidity and a highly engaged community.

![:muscle:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/muscle.png?v=12 ":muscle:") **We have a strong team, solid partners, and investors behind us.**

We are building a long-term business, not playing games.

## [](#catizen-welcome-to-ton-innovators-to-start-can-you-explain-the-core-concept-behind-catizen-and-how-it-integrates-pocketfi-gaming-bots-video-shorts-and-e-commerce-3)**Catizen! Welcome to TON Innovators! To start, can you explain the core concept behind Catizen and how it integrates PocketFi, gaming bots, video shorts, and e-commerce?**

Catizen leverages TON Blockchain to introduce practical mobile payments to Telegram users, marking a significant innovation in both Web3 and Web2 environments. Previously, most Web3 applications needed desktop access, similar to the early stages of Web2. PocketFi could change this by revolutionizing Web3 innovations, similar to how smart contracts improved user interactions and centralized exchanges simplified transactions. PocketFi on TON and Telegram could potentially transform user habits and application scenarios in Web3.

Therefore, drawing on our extensive experience in game development, our team spent significant time analyzing the unique benefits of the TON Ecosystem. After examining many market cases, we decided to create Catizen, a project that merges aspects of Gaming Launchpool with Pinduoduo (internationally known as TEMU). Pinduoduo‚Äôs approach of subsidizing users and cutting prices has successfully overcome major product challenges and amassed a large user base.

Similarly, the widespread use of airdrop strategies in Web3 mirrors Pinduoduo‚Äôs method of attracting new users by offering more benefits. Before its deep integration with WeChat, which had large traffic in the Chinese community but no clear strategy to convert this traffic into active users, Pinduoduo faced similar challenges. The partnership between Pinduoduo and WeChat not only addressed WeChat‚Äôs challenges but also effectively educated users about online applications. In Web3, this approach is recognized as significant by leading institutions. Although many Web3 projects have tried similar strategies, most have not succeeded. However, TON‚Äôs strategic partnership with Telegram offers us a unique opportunity. Catizen aims to become a Web3 modular consumer platform similar to Pinduoduo. We plan to integrate gaming, short video content, and e-commerce, inspired by Pinduoduo‚Äôs success within the WeChat ecosystem. Our strategy involves using a gamified Web3 model to educate and engage Telegram‚Äôs large user base, transforming innovative products into widely used commercial applications. We will use token airdrops and short video promotions to drive exponential growth. Gradually, we will introduce a gaming platform, launchpool, task center, short video content, and e-commerce features, with the ultimate goal of creating a trillion-level Web3 social entertainment platform.

Catizen is more than just a game; it is a platform designed to evolve continuously with its player community. Integrating with launchpool will be a key breakthrough, greatly enhancing benefits for the extensive Catizen community. Over the next year, we will introduce new Mini Apps centered around Catizen as the launchpool platform. As the project progresses, we will integrate aspects of Pinduoduo more deeply into launchpool, incorporating various business streams such as task centers, short dramas, and e-commerce. Catizen ultimately aims to overcome the common problems of many Web3 GameFi projects, such as strong cyclicality and Ponzi schemes.

## [](#did-you-face-any-challenges-when-integrating-all-these-technologies-into-a-single-gamefi-product-what-was-the-development-process-like-4)**Did you face any challenges when integrating all these technologies into a single GameFi product? What was the development process like?**

During the development process, particularly in the beta testing phase, we faced several operational challenges. Fortunately, the TON Foundation offered significant support, helping us quickly resolve these issues. This assistance enabled us to refine Catizen, ensuring it integrates seamlessly with TON Blockchain and Telegram.

**Your new Launchpool has garnered significant attention. How is this related to plans for project development?**

Catizen‚Äôs development plan is organized into five phases, each with distinct focuses and strategies. We are currently entering the second phase:

*   1st Phase: Catizen expanded its user base and enhanced user education primarily through airdrops to encourage registration and wallet activation. The main goal was to teach Telegram users how to use cryptocurrency wallets and participate in transactions, thus converting them into TON users.
    
*   2nd Phase: We are introducing the Catizen Launchpool, where users can stake in-game assets to mine points. These points can be exchanged for our governance token, $CATI. The phase also introduces social cooperative modes to boost mining efficiency. During this stage, Catizen will evolve from a single game into a modular gaming platform with Launchpool functionality, helping users understand DeFi principles.
    

Catizen achieved notable success in its first phase, expanding its user base. 10% of users from the Gaming Bot became TON wallet users, and over 50% became Web3 consumers (PocketFi Users). Catizen is now moving to the second phase‚Äîthe LaunchPool, where players can stake in-game assets to earn points called $wCATI. On April 27 at 13:00 UTC, Catizen updated the Launchpool feature, allowing users to mine $wCATI by staking either fish coins or cats. In this distribution, 60% of the airdropped $wCATI is allocated to players who stake cats, and 40% to those who stake fish coins, with a total of 840 million $wCATI available this period.

To ensure fairness and prevent abuse from players creating multiple accounts, we‚Äôve set participation thresholds for the Launchpool mining:

*   Fish Coin Pool (40%): Players must stake a minimum of 1,000 fish coins to participate, which can be obtained through activities like completing beginner tasks or inviting friends.
*   Cat Pool (60%): Participation requires cats of at least level 110, with higher levels earning greater rewards.

## [](#how-has-ton-blockchain-specifically-benefited-catizen-what-made-you-decide-to-build-on-ton-5)**How has TON Blockchain specifically benefited Catizen? What made you decide to build on TON?**

Firstly, TON Ecosystem has strong potential, as previously mentioned. PocketFi could bring groundbreaking innovations to Web3. The integration of Telegram‚Äôs built-in wallet and bot programs, along with the vigorous development of TON Ecosystem, strengthens the likelihood of this revolution. Secondly, when our team joined the TON Blockchain, the foundation was very responsive, providing expert guidance and financial support for both technical integration and market promotion. Additionally, many leading projects within the ecosystem warmly welcomed our collaboration proposal, which is extremely beneficial for newcomers.

Lastly, the vast early community within TON Ecosystem firmly believes in its future, similar to us. Unlike other ecosystems, we found that the majority of the early TON community actively evangelizes on our behalf. They were eager to discuss and support the development of our project, offer suggestions, and help spread the word, which is quite rare in other blockchain ecosystems.

## [](#tell-us-about-your-community-what-role-have-they-played-in-the-development-and-evolution-of-catizen-6)**Tell us about your community! What role have they played in the development and evolution of Catizen?**

At the time of publication, the Catizen Telegram Announcement Channel has reached over 900,000 subscribers. Initially, our project attracted significant attention from TON‚Äôs native early community, and we successfully engaged a group of users interested in airdrops through in-game guidance. Over the past month, we have collaborated with numerous projects within the TON ecosystem, recognizing this as a vital way to build a quality community.

Additionally, during TOKEN2049 and the early April Hong Kong Web3 Carnival for TON DAY, Catizen was repeatedly highlighted as a success story in TON‚Äôs official presentations. This multi-level exposure has been crucial for acquiring new users. Our team works diligently to meet community demands, constantly refining and improving our product to ensure a seamless transition from promotion to exposure, user acquisition, retention, and community growth.

In the future, the community will be central to the development of Catizen. Airdrops will allow them to become holders of $CATI tokens, sharing in the benefits of the platform. This ownership will serve as proof of their stake in Catizen‚Äôs future rewards. Shared benefits with the community will include features such as the Launchpool, e-commerce, and more.

## [](#can-you-discuss-any-upcoming-features-or-expansions-that-catizen-players-can-look-forward-to-in-the-near-future-7)**Can you discuss any upcoming features or expansions that Catizen players can look forward to in the near future?**

We have discussed the initial and current focus of the development phases: expanding the user base and promoting the Launchpool feature. The next phase, the third phase, aims to transform Catizen into a Telegram gaming platform. We have already signed agreements with 18 popular WeChat mini-games and plan to integrate them with Web3 features on the Catizen gaming platform. Additionally, holders of Catizen‚Äôs governance token will be able to mine tokens for subsequent games through the Catizen mining pool.

## [](#do-you-see-catizen-in-the-future-having-an-impact-on-the-broader-blockchain-and-gamefi-sector-outside-of-ton-8)**Do you see Catizen in the future having an impact on the broader blockchain and GameFi sector outside of TON?**

Catizen has already achieved multi-chain deployment and has partnered with Mantle Network. Our aim is for Catizen to act as a bridge not only between Telegram and TON Blockchain but also between the Ethereum ecosystem and TON. We intend to attract Ethereum users to Catizen, helping them recognize the distinct advantages of TON compared to other blockchains. We deeply understand the unique benefits of TON Ecosystem, which is central to our future development. Moving forward, we will launch major marketing campaigns on TON Catizen and plan to merge the Mantle Network rankings with TON Ecosystem‚Äôs Catizen Leaderboard, preserving the advantages of early TON players as much as possible.

## [](#finally-what-advice-would-you-give-to-other-developers-looking-to-build-gaming-projects-on-ton-blockchain-9)**Finally, what advice would you give to other developers looking to build gaming projects on TON Blockchain?**

We believe that actively communicating with TON Foundation members and participating in their events are very beneficial. Through these activities, we have accessed exceptionally valuable resources like TON Hackerhouse, TON Gateway, and others.

# [Ton StableCoin is coming!](/t/ton-stablecoin-is-coming/1652)

[General](/c/general/4) 

    

[fardint](https://tonresear.ch/u/fardint)  March 29, 2024, 7:07pm  1

In the realm of blockchain development, one of the most pressing concerns for users is the balance between security and autonomy. The TON Coin stablecoin project, housed within the enigmatic repository ‚Äústablecoin-contract‚Äù on [GitHub](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/stablecoin-contract), embodies this delicate balance, stirring both curiosity and apprehension among its community.

At the heart of these concerns lies the significant authority wielded by the stablecoin‚Äôs admin. While some view this centralized control with suspicion, it‚Äôs essential to recognize its purpose: safeguarding users‚Äô assets. In a landscape fraught with security threats and vulnerabilities, centralized oversight can offer a layer of protection against malicious actors and unforeseen events.

Consider the scenario of a user falling victim to a hack or exploit. In such dire circumstances, having an admin with the power to execute transfers, burn jettons, and manipulate wallet statuses can be a lifeline. It provides users with recourse to recover their stablecoins and mitigate potential losses, offering peace of mind in an otherwise turbulent environment.

Furthermore, the ability to lock and unlock wallets serves as a valuable tool in the arsenal of user security. In the event of suspicious activity or unauthorized access, the admin can take swift action to safeguard user funds, preventing further harm and facilitating the swift resolution of security incidents.

Critics may argue that such centralized authority undermines the core tenets of decentralization. However, in a world where threats lurk around every corner, a pragmatic approach to security is paramount. By striking a balance between decentralization and centralized oversight, the TON Coin stablecoin project aims to offer users the best of both worlds: autonomy tempered by vigilance, and security bolstered by swift action.

As we navigate the complexities of blockchain technology, it‚Äôs essential to remember that progress often requires trade-offs. While decentralization remains a noble ideal, it must coexist harmoniously with practical considerations for security and user protection. In this light, the centralized authority of the TON Coin stablecoin project emerges not as a hindrance, but as a beacon of hope in an increasingly perilous digital landscape.

The CAKON application is a game platform deployed on the TON blockchain, utilizing TON Connect 2.0 to operate Telegram Mini Apps (TMA). It offers players a seamless gaming experience and encourages them to earn rewards.

Compared to traditional Web2 game applications, the CAKON app makes it easier for players to get started with the game. Players can begin their gaming experience without having to manage in-game assets themselves. As players‚Äô understanding of the protocol deepens, they have the option to establish their own wallets, maintaining complete control over their assets at all times.

When introducing individuals unfamiliar with the crypto world, we are committed to minimizing barriers in the adoption process as much as possible. By reducing the entry threshold and complexity, we aim to promote the spread and adoption of the game.

Hello, Crypto Enthusiasts and Tech Savvy Individuals,

[![Êà™Âúñ 2024-02-04 ‰∏≠Âçà12.11.43](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/1X/dbcadd468e8c94865bb4053f7867435931ede00e_2_684x500.png)

Today marks a significant milestone in the evolution of cryptocurrency mining with the introduction of the first-ever GRAM mining pool: Ton.Ninja. This innovative platform is poised to revolutionize the way we approach mining, offering unique features and opportunities for participants. Let‚Äôs delve into the essential details of Ton.Ninja and why it‚Äôs garnering attention in the crypto community.

### [](#commission-structure-and-future-adjustments-1)Commission Structure and Future Adjustments

Ton.Ninja is launching with a commission rate of 50%. While this may seem high, it‚Äôs important to understand that the team is actively analyzing pool costs and the commission rate is subject to change in the near future. This approach ensures that the pool remains sustainable while also being fair to its miners.

### [](#share-lifetime-2)Share Lifetime

One of the key features of Ton.Ninja is the share lifetime, set at 60 minutes. This dynamic system is designed to ensure fairness and efficiency in reward distribution, making sure that active participants are adequately compensated for their contributions.

### [](#withdrawal-process-3)Withdrawal Process

Withdrawals are a crucial aspect of any mining pool, and Ton.Ninja has announced that this feature will be enabled tomorrow. This prompt implementation of withdrawals demonstrates the platform‚Äôs commitment to providing a seamless and user-friendly experience for its users.

### [](#pool-address-and-how-to-join-4)Pool Address and How to Join

To participate in Ton.Ninja, miners will need to connect their wallets to the pool. The process is straightforward, ensuring that even those new to mining can easily join. The pool address is UQCqPdkvuiXF79L2YdyYJlKAMztkfAnjae4bwgGGVHvQB\_Am, serving as the gateway to start mining GRAM tokens.

### [](#current-participation-and-share-distribution-5)Current Participation and Share Distribution

Ton.Ninja is already showing impressive participation levels, with a wide range of addresses contributing to the pool. The distribution of shares within the 60-minute window showcases the diversity and engagement of the community. From addresses holding over 36,000 shares to those with just Under 100, the pool is attracting a broad spectrum of miners.

### [](#installation-and-starting-your-mining-journey-6)Installation and Starting Your Mining Journey

Getting started with Ton.Ninja is as simple as connecting your wallet to the pool. This user-friendly approach ensures that participants can quickly become part of the mining community without the need for complex setups.

### [](#why-tonninja-stands-out-7)Why Ton.Ninja Stands Out

Ton.Ninja is not just the first GRAM mining pool; it represents a new direction in the mining landscape. With its unique features, such as the adjustable commission rate and the 60-minute share lifetime, it offers a fresh and potentially more equitable mining environment. The platform‚Äôs commitment to adjusting its commission based on operational costs reflects a transparent and miner-friendly approach.

In conclusion, Ton.Ninja is setting the stage for the future of cryptocurrency mining. Its innovative features and commitment to the community make it an exciting development for both seasoned miners and newcomers alike. As the platform evolves, it will undoubtedly continue to attract attention and participation from across the crypto world.

Join us in this new era of mining by becoming part of the Ton.Ninja community today. Let‚Äôs explore the possibilities and contribute to the growth of this pioneering platform.

Happy Mining!

> Airdrop snapshot: May 7, 00:00 UTC  
> Airdrop execution: May 9

### [](#eligibility-criteria-2)Eligibility criteria

The snapshot captures all wallets that traded whitelisted tokens on DeDust and/or [Ston.Fi](http://Ston.Fi) and NFTs **between April 1, 12:00 UTC and May 7,** **00:00 UTC**. Non-wallet addresses and sybil wallet addresses were disqualified.

Whitelisted assets included the \*\*\*\*tokens and NFT collections of games participating in the [App Battle of The Open League](https://ton.org/en/open-league?filterBy=forProjects) (Ton Punks, Tap Fantasy, Arbuz, Tongochi, Gatto, Fanton, XPLUS, The Pixels).

\*_This is not endorsement or investment advice. The whitelisted assets relate to the projects that take part in the App Battle of The Open League._

To be eligible for the airdrop, the wallet needs to have:

*   at least $200 in the volume of traded tokens and/or NFTs, where the volume is the sum of swaps in pairs with the token and TON / stable coins and the purchases of NFTs on NFT marketplaces‚Ä¶
*   non-zero balance of the whitelisted tokens and/or NFTs at the moment of the snapshot.

The metrics taken into account to calculate each eligible wallet score are as follows:

*   Number of traded assets from the whitelist
*   Total volume of traded tokens and/or NFTs, where the volume is the sum of swaps in pairs with the token and TON / stable coins and the purchases of NFTs.
*   Number of trades performed
*   Current balance of whitelisted assets at the moment of the snapshot.

With the aim of determining the size of the airdrop for each beneficiary, a points system was created. Based on the four above-mentioned metrics, each wallet was assigned points. The sum of the points was the final score. Final scores were then grouped into ranges and the size of rewards for each range of scores was determined.

Dear management of the Open League and Ton Foundation, for the second time you are not sending those drops that they deserve, the first time most of the reward went to wallets with a turnover several times less than many others, and on some wallets the income was as much as three drops . Now you have simply ignored the wallets with the highest turnover and the number of game NFTs. I ask you to pay attention to this, and please, not like last time when you said: ‚ÄúWe see a problem and will figure it out soon,‚Äù this seems to be a disregard for the community, you fed a lot of bots, honest the wallets again received nothing.  
Please check our wallets again and decide finally this problem.

Buckle up, crypto enthusiasts! Bitcoin (BTC) could be in for a wild ride, with options traders placing big bets on a potential surge to six figures by the end of 2024.

This news comes on the heels of a recent rebound that saw Bitcoin climb back to $59,000 after the Federal Reserve signaled a slower pace of interest rate hikes. This has buoyed the confidence of options traders, who are increasingly bullish on the world‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency.

According to reports, call options ‚Äì financial contracts that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase an asset at a certain price by a certain date ‚Äì are seeing a significant increase in activity at strike prices of $100,000 and above. This suggests that a growing number of traders believe Bitcoin has the potential to double its current value in the coming months.

This bullish sentiment is further fueled by comments from industry analysts, who point to several factors that could propel Bitcoin higher. One key driver is the continued institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. Major investment firms like BlackRock are reportedly showing increasing interest in Bitcoin, which could bring a significant influx of new capital into the market.

Another factor is the potential for a ‚ÄúDoomsday Rally‚Äù scenario, where investors flock to safe-haven assets like Bitcoin in the event of a major economic downturn. With global economic uncertainty looming, this scenario could become a reality, pushing Bitcoin prices even higher.

Of course, the cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile, and there are no guarantees that Bitcoin will reach $100,000 by year-end. However, the recent options trading activity and analyst commentary suggest that a significant number of market participants are betting on a major upside for Bitcoin in the coming months.

So, whether you‚Äôre a seasoned crypto investor or just starting out, it‚Äôs certainly a time to watch Bitcoin with interest. The next few months could be a pivotal turning point for the world‚Äôs most popular cryptocurrency.

The blockchain landscape is ever-evolving, with new platforms emerging to challenge the status quo and introduce innovative functionalities. Among these pioneering technologies is the Ton ecosystem, originally conceptualized by Telegram, which aims to redefine user interaction with decentralized networks. This article delves into the fundamental aspects of the Ton ecosystem, exploring its unique features, potential applications, and the impact it could have on the broader blockchain community.

### [](#what-is-the-ton-ecosystem-1)What is the Ton Ecosystem?

The Ton ecosystem, short for The Open Network, is a multi-blockchain platform designed to provide high-speed, scalable transactions and user-friendly applications. Initially developed by Telegram, the project has since been handed over to the open-source community, which continues to develop and expand its capabilities. The core of the Ton ecosystem is built around the principle of decentralization, aiming to enhance accessibility and efficiency in blockchain networks.

### [](#key-features-of-the-ton-ecosystem-2)Key Features of the Ton Ecosystem

#### [](#h-1-high-scalability-and-speed-3)1\. **High Scalability and Speed**

Ton is designed to process millions of transactions per second, thanks to its unique multi-blockchain architecture. This structure allows the network to split and merge to accommodate changes in load, which in turn, ensures high throughput and low latency in transaction processing.

#### [](#h-2-user-friendly-cryptocurrency-wallets-4)2\. **User-Friendly Cryptocurrency Wallets**

Ton provides a seamless user experience with its integrated cryptocurrency wallets that are easy to use and accessible via mobile devices. These wallets support transactions with Ton‚Äôs native token, Toncoin, which can be used for a variety of services within the ecosystem.

#### [](#h-3-decentralized-applications-dapps-5)3\. **Decentralized Applications (DApps)**

The ecosystem supports the development of decentralized applications by providing developers with a flexible and robust platform. These DApps can range from decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to social media platforms, all running on the Ton blockchain without compromising on performance.

#### [](#h-4-smart-contracts-6)4\. **Smart Contracts**

Ton‚Äôs smart contract technology is advanced, allowing for the creation of complex contracts that can execute automatically under specific conditions. This feature is vital for developers looking to innovate and create dynamic DApps within the Ton ecosystem.

### [](#potential-applications-of-the-ton-ecosystem-7)Potential Applications of the Ton Ecosystem

The versatility of the Ton ecosystem makes it suitable for a wide range of applications. In the realm of DeFi, Ton can facilitate faster, cheaper, and more reliable transactions than traditional financial systems. For social media platforms, it offers enhanced privacy and control over data, allowing users to manage their information without interference from central authorities.

Additionally, Ton‚Äôs infrastructure is ideal for supply chain management, providing transparent and immutable records of transactions. This can significantly reduce fraud and errors, ensuring the integrity of data across the supply chain.

### [](#the-impact-on-the-blockchain-community-8)The Impact on the Blockchain Community

The Ton ecosystem represents a significant step forward in the blockchain technology space. By addressing the common challenges of scalability and usability, Ton paves the way for broader adoption of blockchain technology. Its commitment to maintaining a decentralized network while providing a user-friendly experience could set a new standard for future blockchain projects.

Furthermore, the open-source nature of the Ton project encourages collaboration and innovation within the community, fostering an environment where developers can contribute to the ecosystem‚Äôs growth and sustainability.

Hello, I am a student and I have been struggling with a lot of problems recently. I am asking the Ton Coin blockchain community to give me $10,000 in prize money or NFT to start my first business and share my ideas. This grace and forgiveness is only possible with the help of Ton coin community and I hope it will help me ![:slight_smile:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12 ":slight_smile:")

# [Exploring the TON Airdrop: A New Era for Cryptocurrency Adoption](/t/exploring-the-ton-airdrop-a-new-era-for-cryptocurrency-adoption/16802)

[TON Blockchain](/c/ton-blockchain/17)

[Prime\_BCH](https://tonresear.ch/u/Prime_BCH)  May 10, 2024, 4:52am  1

In recent years, the world of cryptocurrencies has seen various strategies to increase user adoption and network activity. One such strategy is the concept of an airdrop, where tokens are distributed for free to the community to encourage usage and ownership. The Open Network (TON), initially launched by the creators of the messaging app Telegram, made headlines with its airdrop, aiming to significantly boost user engagement and decentralize the network further. This article delves into the details of the TON airdrop, exploring its implications for users and the broader cryptocurrency landscape.

**What is TON?**

The Open Network (TON) is a blockchain platform designed to offer high-speed, scalable transactions, and it supports various decentralized applications (dApps). Originally conceptualized by Telegram, TON aims to provide a user-friendly blockchain experience that can accommodate millions of users through its unique multi-blockchain architecture. Although Telegram is no longer officially associated with TON due to regulatory challenges, the project continues under a decentralized group of developers committed to its original vision.

**Details of the TON Airdrop**

The TON airdrop was announced as a method to distribute a significant amount of TON tokens, known as Toncoins, to the community. The primary goal of the airdrop was to incentivize both current and new users to engage with TON‚Äôs platform and services. Here‚Äôs how it worked:

*   **Eligibility and Distribution**: To be eligible for the airdrop, users typically needed to perform specific tasks such as joining the TON community, registering on their platform, or engaging with their applications. The specifics could include holding a certain amount of tokens, interacting with smart contracts, or participating in network governance.
*   **Objectives**: The airdrop aimed to decentralize the ownership of Toncoins, enhance the security of the network by increasing the number of token holders, and drive the adoption of TON‚Äôs dApps.

**Impact on the TON Ecosystem**

The TON airdrop had several impacts on the network and its community:

*   **Increased Adoption**: By distributing tokens freely, TON attracted a broader audience to its platform, which could potentially lead to increased usage of its dApps and services.
*   **Community Building**: Airdrops are a popular way to build a community. By rewarding participants, TON has fostered a more active and engaged community.
*   **Price Volatility**: Like most airdrops, the initial reaction can lead to increased price volatility as new users acquire and potentially sell their free tokens.

**Challenges and Criticisms**

While airdrops are generally well-received, they come with challenges and criticisms:

*   **Regulatory Scrutiny**: Airdrops have attracted attention from regulators, questioning whether they should be classified as securities offerings.
*   **Impact on Token Value**: There‚Äôs a risk that airdrops can dilute the value of a token, especially if large amounts are distributed quickly without enough demand.
*   **Security Risks**: The increase in activity around airdrops can also lead to heightened security risks, including scams and phishing attacks targeting unsuspecting users.

NOTNOT is a a memecoin ingeniously crafted to complement the Notcoin venture, residing on the TON blockchain. Proudly asserting their position as early adopters on the TON chain, the Not Notcoin team distinguishes themselves by avoiding the monotonous landscape of founder‚Äôs pet tokens. We are also the number 1 support token of Notcoin and are as a result probably not nothing.

NotNot aims to complement both Ton and Notcoin ecosystems with its upcoming utilities that include the introduction of the very own NFT‚Äôs called NOTBOTS, an own tapping game, which will likely contribute to bringing more people to TON as it‚Äôs inspired by the very famous game ‚Äúguitar hero‚Äù and you will be able to tap and earn $NOT. NOTNOT also is set to introduce the possibility to stake $NOTNOT in order to earn $NOT. Furthermore $NOTNOT is embarking on a collaborative journey with its community to create an EVM-compatible version of the TON blockchain.

Hello, friends.

Please correct me if I am wrong.

After creating a wallet using the Tonkeeper example, I have an address wallet, its (future) base64 hash by V4 wallet code (simplified). If I change 1 byte in the code of the (future) contract - the address is different.

So I‚Äôm getting a TON to that address. If the TON is a Jetton, the sender needs to create a new TON contract to save my TON. But isn‚Äôt TON a jetton? What is TON? Where to store my TON data?

**Welcome to the WEB3 Entertainment World of the Billion Gems!**

![:gem:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/gem.png?v=12 ":gem:") **What is The Billion Gems?**

**Billion Gems** is the ‚Ññ1 WEB3 Entertainment World on Telegram, where you can create and promote your profile in various rating categories, receive donations, create NFT collections, build teams, farm coins, and compete with opponents in Battle Games. We are building a large project community, investment tools on the TON Blockchain, establishing transparent monetization, and engaging gameplay mechanics to ensure that games and the entertainment segment bring not only joy but also benefits to all holders of the $BLN token.

Our group of companies has been developing Fintech and GameFi products for over 10 years. Our portfolio includes FinTech products and dozens of exciting games with a million-strong audience. We believe in TON as much as we once believed in BTC and have been successfully investing in it since 2012, so we will make a significant contribution to the development of the TON Blockchain.

**Phase ‚Ññ1**

![:trophy:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/trophy.png?v=12 ":trophy:") **Billion Mania**

![:trophy:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/trophy.png?v=12 ":trophy:") **Billion Mania** is the first WEB3 Race for Hype in the World on The TON Blockchain, in which all people on our Planet can take part. Who will be the most popular? Or the richest in the World? Who will come out on top? Maybe Elon Musk, Drake, Morgenshtern, Mellstroy or you? ![:thinking:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/thinking.png?v=12 ":thinking:")

You will be able to compete on a par with popular bloggers, streamers, artists, stand-up comedians, businessmen and popular projects. Promote yourself, your business, startups, blogs, music, films, videos in the Billionverse.

One Million people and projects will go down in history, leaving their mark on the Billionverse crypto space!

This will be a historic moment for everyone who uses cryptocurrencies, and especially for the development of the TON Blockchain ecosystem.

**Billion Mania** is a community project - a project that will become the foundation in the infrastructure of our future projects.

With Billion Mania, we will create **Billionverse** within our entertaining WEB3 World of Billion Gems.

![:white_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:") **Our goals**

![:white_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:") **Our main goal** is not only to attract the maximum audience to our project but also to enable TON Blockchain to attract the attention of even more new investors beyond Telegram and the TON ecosystem. In our plans, we aim to develop not only entertaining and competitive content within the Billion Gems project but also to implement additional projects to scale the TON ecosystem.

We have all the resources and knowledge for this.

![:star:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/star.png?v=12 ":star:") **Unique approach**

![:thinking:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/thinking.png?v=12 ":thinking:") **What is our unique approach?**

In Billion Gems, there‚Äôs no need to rush and form teams right away‚Ä¶ First of all we‚Äôll create value and a community, then we‚Äôll provide infrastructure with maximum distribution.

Thanks to our unique approach, the **Billion Gems Coin ($BLN)** will be one of the most decentralized and distributed tokens on the TON Blockchain. We could have gone the traditional route and done a Fairlaunch, but we want to demonstrate that a project should first learn to earn and showcase a transparent financial model, and secondly, it should protect its investors and holders by having liquidity and a highly engaged community.

![:muscle:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/muscle.png?v=12 ":muscle:") **We have a strong team, solid partners, and investors behind us.**

We are building a long-term business, not playing games.

If people have to pay 1ton for participating in airdrop! And you are asking 1M people for the First round, which means 1M of ton toke for you for free! Do you find everyone so crazy?

 

[billiongems](https://tonresear.ch/u/billiongems) May 13, 2024, 5:29pm  4

We are a fundamental project and build marketing based on the roadmap and strategy described in the documentation. You may not take part in the project and not familiarize yourself with the project documentation if you consider it necessary.

We are confident in what we are doing and strongly recommend that everyone start reading project documentation, rather than buying memes and losing hundreds and thousands of TON on it.

We will be happy to help you understand the project and will soon provide extensive information about the project and our development.  
We will be glad if in the future you change your point of view on our project for the better.  
We assure you, we will not let you down! ![:handshake:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/handshake.png?v=12 ":handshake:")

Our Hackathon application is here: [TON Map | Buidls | DoraHacks](https://dorahacks.io/buidl/11685)

The TONmap project introduces an innovative concept combining a map and an app, inspired by the success of [milliondollarhomepage.com](http://milliondollarhomepage.com/) . By adding TON, accessibility to millions of Telegram users, competitive elements, and modern ideas, TONmap aims to create a lasting impact and offer the opportunity to mine a meme coin.

Each pixel on the TONmap canvas is priced at 1 TON and comes with coordinates, a sequential number, an image, a description, and the owner‚Äôs wallet or Telegram username. This allows users to customize their display and showcase their territory on the main TON/Telegram map.

The project serves as a vast advertising platform for projects and individuals in the TON and Telegram ecosystems, offering continuous advertisement on the website, map, and mini-app. It follows the legacy of [milliondollarhomepage.com](http://milliondollarhomepage.com/) while embedding itself in the history of blockchain.

![:heavy_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/heavy_check_mark.png?v=12 ":heavy_check_mark:") Each pixel, besides being priced at 1 TON, has coordinates (999x999), a sequential number (0 - 999 999), an image, a description, the wallet or Telegram username of the owner, and a link. All of this is publicly accessible on the map to every visitor. You can customize what to display.

![:heavy_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/heavy_check_mark.png?v=12 ":heavy_check_mark:") The buying process is extremely simple. Connect your wallet => Buy button => Select one or multiple pixels => Confirm the transaction.

![:heavy_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/heavy_check_mark.png?v=12 ":heavy_check_mark:") Now, on the main TON/Telegram map, you have your place, your land, your advertising space, and a place for self-expression. And, of course, access to the full functionality of our Mini-app in Telegram.

![:heavy_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/heavy_check_mark.png?v=12 ":heavy_check_mark:") Everyone will have the opportunity to showcase their territories, the most exquisite and rare pixels, and simply the status of the most successful NFT owner on TON.

The conceptual aspects of the project:

*   A vast advertising platform for projects and people in TON and Telegram (advertisement on the website, on the map, in the mini-app, continuously, for years).
*   A significant experiment; owning a pixel is prestigious. You can receive discounts on goods and bonuses from partners.
*   Embed yourself in the history of blockchain.
*   Your personal corner/metaverse in TON.
*   You can buy now, and sell later with conversion to NFT.
*   Every pixel owner will be able to mine a coin within the application with bonuses.
*   Bridge to onboard TON users on Near through Punks

### [](#mission-9)Mission.

The mission of TONmap is to provide users with a massive advertising platform, leaving a lasting mark in history for both the project and each user, while spreading TON to the masses.

The project engages users through activities such as referral programs, coin claims, completing tasks, boosting cities, and renting out pixels.

### [](#activity-10)Activity.

*   Referral for coins, which can be exchanged for TON (10%).
*   Coin claims once every N hours, which will receive liquidity from TON staking and USDT.
*   Completing tasks for coins.
*   Boosting cities (channels) and their movement to the top.
*   Renting out your pixels.
*   Other activities under development.

### [](#tokenomics-11)Tokenomics

Tokenomics involves coin farming, voting for denominations, and token rollout, with a portion of the funds allocated to staking mechanisms. At least 50% of the proceeds from pixel sales will be invested back into the ecosystem.

The plan is to release approximately 50,000 - 100,000 TON for token liquidity (assuming all pixels are sold). Additionally, a significant portion of the funds will be allocated to various staking mechanisms to ensure a consistent flow of funds into token liquidity and project development.

Target audience: Telegram and TON users, who want to advertise their project on the canvas, or inscribe themselves into history

By submitting the form I confirm that the data I provided is correct and I fully understand that in case of the contrary, my project will be permanently eliminated from The Open League

Thanks!

[tep](https://tonresear.ch/tag/tep), [func](https://tonresear.ch/tag/func), [learn](https://tonresear.ch/tag/learn)

    

[Prime\_BCH](https://tonresear.ch/u/Prime_BCH)  May 11, 2024, 2:06am  1

A leading cryptocurrency venture capital firm, Pantera Capital, has potentially invested a significant amount in the TON ecosystem. This news caused the price of TON‚Äôs native token, Ton coin (TON), to jump over 13%.

Pantera Capital‚Äôs exact investment amount remains undisclosed, but it‚Äôs speculated to be well above $250 million. This investment decision comes from Pantera‚Äôs belief in TON‚Äôs potential to bring cryptocurrency to a wider audience due to its integration with the popular messaging app Telegram.

‚ÄúTON has the capacity to introduce crypto to the masses because it is used extensively within the Telegram network,‚Äù Pantera Capital stated. ‚ÄúBy leveraging Telegram‚Äôs vast user base and seamless UX with the vibrancy of TON‚Äôs emerging ecosystem, we believe TON has the potential to become one of the largest crypto networks.‚Äù

Following Pantera Capital‚Äôs announcement, the price of TON surged past $6.8, nearing its all-time high of $7.25.

This investment news coincides with Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov‚Äôs recent unveiling of new features at a crypto conference. These features aim to integrate TON more closely with the Telegram messaging platform, including plans for users to log in using crypto wallets.

Background on TON

It‚Äôs important to note that TON‚Äôs journey hasn‚Äôt been without challenges. In 2019, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a restraining order against Telegram, preventing them from launching their planned token, Gram. The SEC alleged that Telegram‚Äôs token offering violated securities laws.

Despite this setback, TON‚Äôs development continued thanks to its community of supporters. More recently, Telegram has deepened its ties with TON by integrating Ton coin as a payment method within its advertising revenue-sharing program for channel owners.

## [](#describe-the-mechanism-of-providing-liquidity-on-your-platform-5)Describe the mechanism of providing liquidity on your platform

There are two mechanisms by which a user can provide liquidity. The first and most basic is where the user adds liquidity to one of the DEXs, participating in a farming program, thereby earning $PET tokens as a reward.

The second is more complex, where a user can not only add liquidity on a DEX but also lock LP tokens on our platform, in return receiving special in-game items at [https://api.tongochi.org/staking](https://api.tongochi.org/staking).

## [](#your-plans-attach-a-document-6)Your Plans \[attach a document\]

Submit a document (of any format) that clearly outlines your plan to grow TVL at risk. Indicate the current metrics and the expected change. You can provide 3 scenarios with the estimates for a potential duration of the incentives of 1, 3 and 6 months. Please describe how you will design the program and which specific marketing means you will be using to attract liquidity providers.

By submitting the form I confirm that the data I provided is correct and I fully understand that in case of the contrary, my project will be permanently eliminated from The Open League.

An idea is nothing, if great team doesn‚Äôt stay behind it. Idea of Tongochi and all related existing or new-baking games have it. It has the well-stacked team, in with I as a client and user of their products can prove. Just ask me: ‚ÄúDo I believe in project‚Äôs future?‚Äù. I reply: ‚ÄúYes, I do. And it has valuable future for whom would like to get more knowledge about crypto and tokenomics through the game‚Äù. So it is small part what I could share with you‚Ä¶ thanks.

While being nominally a meme token, propelled by memes, $BOLT has more utility than some of the major projects on TON. It grants access to several useful and fun communities, it unites many talented developers of Telegram Bots and TON smart contracts and has been the driver for several handy products in Telegram crypto ecosystem. Thus, I believe it is entirely eligible for the minor League and eventually the main League!

One of the oldest tokens, and one of those most truthful to the principles of TON: it‚Äôs open, it‚Äôs fair, it‚Äôs truly decentralized and it pushes the ecosystem forward with its community-driven products.

Memes come and go. Fashion trends fade. Ambitious projects crash, and influential people lose their hard-earned reputation. Everything changes.

Shitcoin ($SHIT) / TON memecoin

[Website](https://tonshitcoin.xyz/)

[Telegram](https://t.me/Shitcoinrun)

[Twitter](https://x.com/shitcoinrun)

Shitcoin! A cryptocurrency with little to no value or a digital currency that has no immediate discernible purpose.

Shitcoin trading has already become a meme. Why shitcoins so attractive? Constant threats of ragpools, huge volatility, teams constantly disappearing into oblivion. Despite all this problems traders monitor screeners in hope. They want the Chosen One. Lowcap give them hope for a wife-change money in case the coin will make it.

‚ÄúThe one‚Äù is already here. We made one shitcoin to rule them all. If you want to buy a shitcoin you no longer have to choose which one. Shitcoin is here.

$shitcoin was created in order to gather a strong community around itself and generate as many memes as possible as soon as possible.

Yes, this project was reviewed objectively. Smart contract approved. Their social interactions were controlled. It was observed that there was an extremely high interaction. Coingecko listing is complete. A team review was conducted and it was observed that they were in communication with the community and transparent. Nothing negative was reported. They have a chance to get into the Open League. Investment can be made.

## [](#guide-how-to-hide-scam-nfts-correctly-1)\[Guide\] How to hide scam NFTs correctly

[![Imgur](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8a3b98752efd03a563d462544dc86aaaa983cd58.jpeg "imgur.com")](https://imgur.com/YrzvcjM)

Scam NFTs on the TON blockchain has recently become mainstream.

Every day we can see hundreds of people‚Äôs messages receiving them and don‚Äôt know what to do next, or do it incorrectly.

In this article we will look at correct methods of interacting with scam NFTs.

**Brief overview:** we will use functions of the wallet itself to visually hide NFT or send it to the zero ‚Äúburn‚Äù address (highly not recommended): `UQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJKZ`

For example I took most popular non-custodial wallets: [Tonkeeper](https://tonkeeper.com/) and [MyTonWallet](https://mytonwallet.io/).

* * *

### [](#tonkeeper-2)Tonkeeper

The most common suboptimal action made by users of this wallet is sending scam NFTs to a zero ‚Äúburn‚Äù address.

**You don‚Äôt have to do this**, nor do you have to **pay network fees** for send transaction. In any case, scam NFT will sooner or later completely disappear from all wallets that hold it.

For you, this wallet has built-in functionality, you can literally **visually hide** any NFTs from your wallet in few taps.

* * *

As you see, I have scam NFT in my collectibles.

[![tonkeeper - step 1](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/3/33d0d14a9129cc43ac33dabe9a2d9a244a78cef9_2_232x500.png)

* * *

I go to main Wallet page, then click **Settings** button.

[![tonkeeper - step 2](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/624755a830e322a60638898b0a7a44983a17f586_2_232x500.png)

* * *

In Settings we need to choose **Tokens**.

[![tonkeeper- step 3](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/1/14509474da83fc2e7a467599ae80b4645f5a27ed_2_232x500.png)

* * *

In Tokens page we go to **Collectibles category**.

Here you will see all you NFTs.

We need to tap on ‚Äúhide‚Äù icon near item to make it hidden.

You can hide unnecessary or scam tokens from your wallet here too.

[![tonkeeper - step 4](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/bcbe98662d99129dae740df7e4aaeefed26e3057_2_232x500.png)

* * *

Now scam NFT is in **Hidden** subcategory and you won‚Äôt see it in your Collectibles anymore.

[![tonkeeper - step 5](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/3/35eaf2eae37ab76dba0d97b1128a8529bd30fe6f_2_232x500.png)

](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/original/2X/3/35eaf2eae37ab76dba0d97b1128a8529bd30fe6f.png "tonkeeper - step 5")

In this way we totally free **visually** hid scam NFT from Tonkeeper wallet.

But you can continue to see it in [tonscan](https://tonscan.org/) / [tonviewer](https://tonviewer.com/). If you don‚Äôt want scam NFT to be visible there too, then unfortunately there are only two options: either just wait, or send it to a zero burning address (highly not recommended): `UQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJKZ`.  
Please note that you will need to pay a network fee for the sending transaction.

* * *

### [](#mytonwallet-3)MyTonWallet

Unfortunately, this wallet **does not provide function of visually ‚Äúhiding‚Äù NFTs**, which is a significant flaw in our case.

But it will help you quickly send scam NFT to a zero ‚Äúburn‚Äù address.

* * *

In the **NFT** page click three dots near item you want to burn.

[![mytonwallet - step 1](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/1/1d3e7b5f121b935480386eedb5842e05e80bdc63_2_232x500.png)

* * *

Select **Burn**.

[![mytonwallet - step 2](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/7/79511658bfa470ca9ff3ac18f69e8ef66972fa63_2_232x500.png)

* * *

Next we will see **transaction page**, that was automatically created. The zero ‚Äúburn‚Äù address is entered in the Receiving Address. Tap **Burn NFT**.

In this case **we need to pay network fee** for send transaction.

I believe that users **should not give any money for this action**, if we are talking about scam and users safety. And I think this should be resolved. That‚Äôs one of the reasons why I recommend Tonkeeper. Also, some NFTs have doubtful code in contracts, which can lead to unexpected consequences, so the following actions are at your own risk.

[![mytonwallet - step 3](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/1/19677a634cd552c34ca17e2802c7a4fd36f1b9b8_2_232x500.png)

* * *

As soon as the transaction is completed, we will see such a message and scam NFT will be deleted from our wallet **forever**.

[![mytonwallet - step 4](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/3/3ac6f61bec2b6bda3a5ee663e5ab909795bcb27a_2_232x500.png)

So, in this article we figured out how to hide / remove scam NFT for free / for a small commission using the example of several wallets. Be careful!

If you have any questions, please leave them in this thread.

 

[Jason\_J](https://tonresear.ch/u/Jason_J) September 13, 2024, 9:20pm  2

Well, I clicked on two of them. Then I got suspicious and reported them as scams. I hope I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. What do you think? Should I transfer my tokens to another wallet?

 

[petrovxyz](https://tonresear.ch/u/petrovxyz) September 13, 2024, 10:00pm  3

Hi! You don‚Äôt need to do anything else. **You did everything correctly ![:white_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:").**

This article can be considered as **outdated** because both popular wallets now have the function of marking NFT as a scam, then they will hide automatically (without the need to burn it or otherwise interact with it).

**Exploring Oyster Labs‚Äô Universal Basic Smartphone (UBS) on Ton Blockchain: A Brief Analysis**

## [](#project-details-1)Project Details

*   Website: [Universal Basic Smartphone](https://universalphone.xyz)
*   Telegram: [Oyster Labs: Universal Phone](https://t.me/universalphone888)
*   Twitter(X): [Oyster Labs: Universal Phone (Ton X Hashkey)](https://twitter.com/oysterecosystem)

**Disclaimer:**  
This research is based solely on publicly available information and is not intended as financial advice. Readers are encouraged to conduct their own research before engaging with or abstaining from the mentioned project.

**Key Abbreviations:**

*   Ton: The Open Network
*   UBS: Universal Basic Smartphone

**1\. Understanding the Concept**

**What is the Universal Basic Smartphone (UBS)?**  
The Universal Basic Smartphone (UBS) is pioneering an inclusive digital economy by ensuring fair compensation for personal data. In the age of artificial intelligence, businesses profit significantly from the use of personal data without explicit consent. UBS advocates for a future where everyone receives their fair share by enabling individuals to reclaim ownership of their data. As a proponent of a paradigm where participation is rewarded, UBS is committed to a digital ecosystem that prioritizes reciprocity.

**How does Oyster Labs envision the UBS to function and its role in providing digital access to underserved populations?**  
Oyster Labs envisions the Universal Basic Smartphone (UBS) as a gateway to a more equitable digital landscape, offering users not just a device, but a path to empowerment and financial inclusion. When you purchase a UBS, you‚Äôre not just getting a phone ‚Äì you‚Äôre entering a world where your data has value and you have control.

**2\. Ton Blockchain Integration**

**What is the Ton blockchain and its features that make it suitable for the UBS project?**  
The Open Network (TON) is a decentralized platform developed by the team behind the messaging app Telegram. It‚Äôs designed to be a scalable and efficient blockchain infrastructure that supports a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps) and services.

One of the key features that make TON suitable for the UBS project is its scalability. TON uses a unique mechanism called the ‚ÄúInfinite Sharding Paradigm‚Äù to achieve high throughput and scalability. This allows the network to process a large number of transactions per second, making it capable of handling the demands of a smartphone ecosystem where millions of users may be interacting simultaneously.

Another important feature of TON is its support for smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. These contracts enable automated and trustless interactions between parties, which can be particularly beneficial for the UBS project. Smart contracts can be used to automate processes such as data monetization, rewards distribution, and decentralized application management on the UBS platform.

Additionally, TON has built-in support for decentralized storage and micropayments. This means that users of the UBS can securely store their data on the blockchain and easily monetize it through micropayments, all without relying on centralized intermediaries. This aligns well with the goals of the UBS project, which aims to empower users to control and monetize their data.

**How does UBS leverage the Ton blockchain for its operations, such as identity verification, secure transactions, and data storage?**  
UBS taps into the potential of the TON blockchain, facilitated by its integration with Telegram, one of the world‚Äôs largest social networking platforms. With a vast user base, Telegram offers a solid foundation for projects seeking widespread adoption of their technology. The TON blockchain, when seamlessly integrated within the UBS, will enable secure transactions, promising a frictionless experience for users. However, while the current focus lies on transactional efficiency, the specifics of utilizing the TON blockchain for identity verification and data storage remain unclear due to a lack of technical documentation. Moving forward, clarity on how UBS will harness the capabilities of the TON blockchain in these critical areas will be essential for its evolution and efficacy.

**3\. Technical Specifications**

*   Appearance: Cyber Silver
*   Battery: 4050mAh Lithium-ion battery
*   Charging: Type-C Input / Fast charge?
*   Connectivity: 4G NETWORK TDD(B38\\B39\\B40\\B41),FDD (B1\\2\\3\\4\\5\\7\\8\\12\\17\\20\\28A\\28BÔºâ
*   Memory & Storage: Memory 6GB RAM, Storage 128GB
*   Operating System: OS Android 10 or 14?
*   Platform: MTK6762 8 Core
*   Processor: CPU Type(s) Arm Cortex-A53, Max CPU Frequency 2.0GHz, Cores Octa (8), CPU Bit 64-bit
*   Camera: Max Camera ISP 13MP + 8MP, 21MP

The current specifications of the phone align with the project‚Äôs goal to offer a basic, affordable, and functional smartphone tailored for TON blockchain users.

**Manufacturer:**  
Details regarding the company responsible for overseeing the manufacturing process have not been publicly disclosed.

**4\. Economic Model**  
At present, there is no detailed economic model outlining the company‚Äôs revenue generation strategies or identifying their backers. However, for users who invest in the phone, there are multiple income streams available. These include airdrops from partner projects and cashback benefits accessible for both Web2 and Web3 platforms through the OysterEarn app.

*   $ANTON: [https://twitter.com/anton\_ton\_](https://twitter.com/anton_ton_)

[More](https://t.me/universalphone888)

These are just a few of the ecosystem projects willing to support UBS holders after the device has been delivered. Additionally, more projects are partnering with the team to integrate their applications into the phone.

**Teams and Experience:**  
The details regarding the team members and their expertise have not been disclosed on the official website.

**5\. Social Impact**  
The Universal Basic Smartphone (UBS) has the potential to have a significant social impact by increasing digital inclusion and access to financial services, particularly in underserved communities. Here‚Äôs how:

*   Digital Inclusion: UBS aims to provide a basic, affordable smartphone solution that can bridge the digital divide by making technology more accessible to those who may not have had access to a dedicated device closely tied to a blockchain. By lowering the barrier to entry, UBS can empower individuals from diverse socio-economic backgrounds to participate in the digital world, access information, and connect with others globally.
*   Access to Financial Services: Many underserved populations lack access to traditional banking services. UBS, with its support for Web3 platforms and integration with financial apps, can offer users access to essential financial services such as banking, payments, and remittances.
*   Education and Information: With access to the internet and educational resources, UBS users can enhance their knowledge and skills. This can have a transformative impact on education, allowing individuals to access online courses, educational materials, and information resources. Increased access to education can lead to improved employment opportunities and economic mobility.
*   Empowerment Through Data Ownership: UBS‚Äôs emphasis on data ownership and control empowers users to monetize their data and benefit from the digital economy. By giving users control over their personal information, UBS enables individuals to participate more actively in online transactions and digital interactions while protecting their privacy and security.

Overall, the UBS has the potential to empower individuals, enhance socio-economic opportunities, and contribute to building more inclusive and equitable societies by increasing digital inclusion and access to essential services. However, it‚Äôs crucial to ensure that efforts are made to reach marginalized communities and address potential barriers to adoption, such as affordability, literacy, and connectivity issues.

The Open Project will tie Blockchains together with unique ecosystem with digital goods marketplace.

I think that TON and Open goals are similar: make cryptocurrencies popular among people, bring business to TON blockchain, tie different blockchains with power of The Open Network.

Most of businesses on TON are gambling and scammy jettons, but The Open Project is making marketplace for real products, that people really use and trade outside of crypto world.

So, if TON want to develop ecosystem with business that has real economics, it must support The Open Project.

YesCoin indeed shows promising potential with its interactive gameplay, rewarding system, and social engagement features. With its increasing popularity and active user base, the future outlook for YesCoin seems bright. The continuous development and introduction of new features could further enhance the user experience and ensure sustained growth in the cryptocurrency gaming space. especially given the collaboration with Toncoin.

[vanishmax](https://tonresear.ch/u/vanishmax)  May 14, 2024, 9:00am  1

Hey folks! Happy to present the [**Foton**](https://foton.sh/) library for creating TON dApps with ease! ![:zap:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/zap.png?v=12 ":zap:")

No need for mixing up tonweb, toncore, tonconnect and tonapi. No need for wondering what are cells and slices. Just use Foton and do what you need.

The library currently supports:

![:white_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:") Wallet connection

![:white_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:") Sending transactions

![:white_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:") Querying the blockchain

![:white_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:") Deploying and interacting with smart contracts

![:white_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:") Blueprint and TON Connect integration for easy code migrations

![:white_check_mark:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12 ":white_check_mark:") Type safe interfaces with full auto-completion for contract methods and returns

You can start with Foton by building a [simple Counter dApp in React](https://foton.sh/docs/guides/tutorial). This tutorial will help you set up the environment, connect to a wallet and work with the counter smart contract.

![:rocket:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/rocket.png?v=12 ":rocket:") This is the first release of Foton, so expect that features might not work as expected. If you encounter any problem, please report it to [GitHub issues](https://github.com/VanishMax/foton/issues) or to the [Telegram chat](https://t.me/fotonjs).

In most of the programs, there is no verbal relationship between the participating audiences, within the program, people can accumulate small amounts of money by sharing with friends or communicating with people in the program, and by putting together a large capital, and within the program, there are several levels, amounts, and various offers for the final profit. Of course, there are many details that this plan will attract a lot of capital, as well as more international communication and more audience.

# [Comprehensive API Monitoring with Tonstat.us: Insights from the Last 6 Hours](/t/comprehensive-api-monitoring-with-tonstat-us-insights-from-the-last-6-hours/180)

[Application](/c/application/20) 

[api](https://tonresear.ch/tag/api)

    

[Simpson](https://tonresear.ch/u/Simpson)   February 4, 2024, 7:58am  1

Hello everyone,

I wanted to share with the community a powerful tool that has been instrumental in monitoring the performance of APIs related to the TON blockchain. The website [Tonstat.us](https://tonstat.us/) provides a real-time dashboard powered by Grafana that showcases the status of all TON-related APIs, with data updated every 5 minutes.

[![Êà™Âúñ 2024-02-04 ‰∏ãÂçà3.55.39](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/1X/9ad61a3838a3c9bc320748047b052da19ee9a8e9_2_690x382.png)

Êà™Âúñ 2024-02-04 ‰∏ãÂçà3.55.391920√ó1065 279 KB

](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/original/1X/9ad61a3838a3c9bc320748047b052da19ee9a8e9.png "Êà™Âúñ 2024-02-04 ‰∏ãÂçà3.55.39")

In the last six hours, here are some critical insights:

**API Uptime**

*   `dton`: 100.00%
*   `getblock.io`: 49.90%
*   `orbs http-api`: 99.72%
*   `public liteservers`: 1.74%
*   `tonapi`: 100.00%
*   `toncenter.com v2`: 100.00%
*   `toncenter.com v3`: 99.93%
*   `tonhub`: 100.00%

**Service Availability**

*   The service availability section provides a bar graph indicating the status over time, with green representing available and red indicating downtime.

**Indexing Latency**

*   Latencies ranged from 475 ms to 2 min, as seen in the bar chart. This metric is crucial for applications that rely on up-to-date blockchain data.

**Get Account Balance Latency**

*   This performance metric shows response times as low as 9.50 ms and as high as 10 seconds, which is critical for services requiring real-time balance information.

Here‚Äôs a brief tabular summary of the most crucial points:

API Service

Uptime

Indexing Latency (ms)

Account Balance Latency (ms)

dton

100.00%

475 - 120,000

9.50 - 10,000

‚Äì

‚Äì

tonhub

‚Äì

The reliability of the `dton`, `tonapi`, `toncenter.com v2`, and `tonhub` APIs has been impressive, maintaining 100% uptime. However, `getblock.io` and `public liteservers` have shown significant instability, which may require attention from their respective teams.

[Tonstat.us](http://Tonstat.us) provides an invaluable service to developers, investors, and enthusiasts who need to keep a close eye on the infrastructure supporting TON blockchain operations. By utilizing Grafana dashboards, [Tonstat.us](http://Tonstat.us) brings a level of transparency and accountability that is vital for decentralized technologies.

Feel free to explore the dashboard for more detailed information and to make informed decisions based on the performance of these APIs.

Stay tuned for further updates and discussions.

Paper $PLANE is a memecoin based on the historic moment when Russia tried to ban Telegram in 2018 and Pavel Durov called on everyone to throw paper planes as a sign of resistance.

A paper plane is also associated with the iconic Telegram logo. Although $PLANE has no association with Telegram, the $PLANE logo is a mix of the old Telegram logo created in 2013 fused with the most current Telegram logo created in 2019.

Not only is $PLANE a memecoin with a timeless narrative, $PLANE has developed an addictive game playable directly as a Telegram app. This game has been used to bring awareness to the TON ecosystem by forging collaborations with other projects on TON.

Paper planes are timeless and know no boundaries as they fly free and effortlessly, or better yet, as the founder of Telegram says,  
‚ÄúThe original meaning of the paper plane on the Telegram logo means freedom.‚Äù

*   Pavel Durov

As of March 30th, the $PLANE metrics are

*   $2.20 million FDV
*   $116k TVL
*   1571 Holders
*   Approximately $50k daily volume consistently
*   2 month old project

Probably everyone has watched the cartoon ‚ÄúSpongeBob‚Äù, and so, in this project you will see five main characters from that same cartoon. Each character depends on each other, if you watch the cartoon you will see a clear example of how this story is repeated already in BIKINITON. At the moment, only two characters have been released, Plankton and Krabs, but this is just the beginning, an NFT utility is on the way, and what will happen next, you ask? But I won‚Äôt answer this question, I‚Äôll just say that the project has huge growth potential and I believe in it with all my heart and soul! Thank you for your attention!

$PLANKTON is the best meme coin on the TON blockchain, because we have a strong and active community that is passionate about the project. The team behind the token implements token-burning events, which reduces the overall supply and increases the coin‚Äôs rarity and value over time. Utility is coming in April. Don‚Äôt miss your chance to invest in the most perspective coin - $PLANKTON.

# [\[TEP-121\] Lockable Jetton Wallet: Enhancing Contract Interface with Locked Balance Feature](/t/tep-121-lockable-jetton-wallet-enhancing-contract-interface-with-locked-balance-feature/182)

[Application](/c/application/jetton/26)  [Jetton](/c/application/jetton/26)

[doge](https://tonresear.ch/u/doge)  February 4, 2024, 11:12am  1

## [](#introduction-1)Introduction

This document proposes an enhancement to the Jetton Wallet, specifically through the introduction of a `get_locked_balance` method. This addition aims to accommodate scenarios where jetton transfers need to be temporarily disabled, without disrupting the functionality of existing services by displaying a zero balance.

## [](#motivation-2)Motivation

The rationale behind this proposal is to address the needs of new contracts that may require the temporary suspension of jetton transfers. Such a feature is pivotal for:

1.  **Jetton DAO Contracts:** To prevent jetton transfers while voting processes are ongoing.
2.  **Jetton Vesting Contracts:** To enable the scheduled release of tokens in the future.

By integrating the `get_locked_balance` method, these contracts can effectively manage jetton availability, enhancing both security and functionality.

## [](#implementation-guide-3)Implementation Guide

The `get_locked_balance` method, when invoked, should return three key pieces of information:

*   **Integer Jetton Balance:** The current balance of the wallet.
*   **Integer Locked Jetton Balance:** The amount of jettons that are currently locked.
*   **Expiration Date:** The UNIX epoch seconds indicating when the locked jettons will be released.

### [](#specification-4)Specification

#### [](#jetton-wallet-contracts-5)Jetton Wallet Contracts

The Jetton Wallet contracts are expected to implement the `get_locked_balance` method as follows:

```
(int, int, int) get_locked_balance() method_id {
  (int balance, slice owner_address,
          slice jetton_master_address, cell jetton_wallet_code,
          int locked, int lock_expiration,
          cell vote_keeper_code) = load_data();
  return (balance, locked, lock_expiration);
}
```

This implementation ensures that the wallet can communicate the locked balance and its expiration date, thereby providing clarity and transparency regarding the available and inaccessible jetton amounts.

## [](#considerations-6)Considerations

### [](#drawbacks-7)Drawbacks

The proposed standard introduces the limitation of having a single locked balance and a single expiration date for that balance.

### [](#rationale-and-alternatives-8)Rationale and Alternatives

The design choice to display both the available and locked balances separately aims to enhance user experience and clarity. It allows for a straightforward representation of funds in blockchain explorers and wallets. An alternative approach could involve multiple locked balances with respective expiration dates; however, this could complicate the user interface and backend logic.

## [](#conclusion-9)Conclusion

The proposed enhancement to the Jetton Wallet, through the addition of a `get_locked_balance` method, represents a significant step towards more versatile and secure contract interactions. By allowing contracts to manage jetton availability with precision, this proposal not only addresses immediate functional needs but also opens up future possibilities for innovative contract designs and applications.

\# Summary This proposal suggests extending the Jetton Wallet by adding the op[‚Ä¶](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/pull/121)tion \`get\_locked\_balance\` get method. # Motivation New contracts have may want to disable jetton transfer until a time in the future. For this case, the Jetton Wallet should show zero balance to not affect old services and add a new get method to allow to get a locked balance and expiration date. The standard may use for: 1. Jetton DAO contract may want to disable jetton transfer until voting is in progress. 2. Jetton Vesting contract may want to release tokens in the future.

# [](#game-hub-10)Game Hub

### [](#h-11)

Abstract

The Fun Worlds Game Hub is a pioneering protocol within the Fun Worlds ecosystem, designed to seamlessly integrate external ERC-20 tokens into a cohesive gaming environment. This protocol serves as a gateway, enabling token holders to utilize their assets across a multitude of gaming experiences, creating a symbiotic relationship between token issuers, gamers, community leaders, and game developers. By leveraging smart contract technology, the Game Hub ensures a fair, transparent, and equitable distribution of revenue, fostering a thriving, decentralized gaming community.

### [](#h-12)

Introduction

The advent of blockchain technology has revolutionized the concept of digital ownership and value exchange. Fun Worlds, as a cutting-edge platform, introduces the Game Hub protocol - a nexus of gaming and DeFi (Decentralized Finance) that empowers participants with true ownership and incentivizes contributions through a sustainable revenue-sharing model.

### [](#h-13)

Game Hub Protocol Mechanics

#### [](#h-14)

Token Integration

ERC-20 token issuers can integrate their tokens with the Game Hub protocol, allowing these assets to be actively used within the Fun Worlds gaming experiences. This integration provides tokens with enhanced utility, driving their circulation and value within the ecosystem.

#### [](#h-15)

Gaming Participation and Incentives

Gamers utilize integrated tokens to engage in various activities, including PvP battles, tournaments, and other in-game transactions. This engagement is incentivized through a transparent revenue-sharing model, where a portion of the transaction fees contribute to the ecosystem‚Äôs growth and sustainability.

#### [](#h-16)

Revenue Generation and Distribution

The Game Hub protocol generates revenue through transaction fees derived from in-game activities. These fees are automatically allocated by smart contracts, ensuring an immutable and transparent distribution process.

#### [](#h-17)

Staking Mechanism

Stakeholders, including gamers, community leaders, and developers, can stake native ‚ÄòGemstones‚Äô within the Game Hub protocol. The staked assets entitle holders to a share of the accumulated transaction fees, aligning their interests with the long-term success of the platform.

#### [](#h-18)

Governance Participation

Stakers may also receive governance rights, allowing them to participate in critical decisions regarding the protocol‚Äôs development, fee structures, and new game integrations.

### [](#h-19)

Security and Transparency

All processes within the Game Hub protocol are executed through auditable smart contracts on the blockchain. This ensures the security of assets and the integrity of the revenue-sharing model.

### [](#h-20)

Sustainability and Growth

The Game Hub‚Äôs design promotes sustained user engagement and ecosystem growth. By providing tangible economic benefits for participation and contribution, the protocol aims to maintain a vibrant and active community.

## [](#h-21)

Openness of Game Hub

One of the key attributes of Game Hub is its openness, which is reflected in the following aspects:

*   **Third-Party Game Integration:** Game developers have the opportunity to plug their games into Game Hub, leveraging its built-in player base and token economy without the need to establish their own.
    
*   **Token Integration:** Game Hub supports a variety of ERC-20 tokens, offering flexible payment and reward options for different games and platforms.
    
*   **Governance Voting:** Holders of FUNW and Gems can participate in governance voting to decide which new games or tokens can be integrated into Game Hub.
    

### [](#h-22)

Conclusion

The Fun Worlds Game Hub protocol represents an innovative convergence of gaming and blockchain technology. By fostering a decentralized and incentivized ecosystem, it aims to redefine the gaming landscape, providing a model for fair and transparent revenue sharing. Through this protocol, Fun Worlds envisions a future where all stakeholders are empowered to contribute to and benefit from the platform‚Äôs success.

The first batch of NFTs is about to sell out.Under the revolutionary wave of Web3, we are witnessing the birth of a new digital social paradigm. Fun Worlds is a key player in this transformation, committed to merging social gaming with decentralized finance (DeFi) to create a unique GameFi ecosystem. This is a community-driven, reward-rich virtual space that allows players to enjoy real value creation while being entertained.

Our vision is to provide a platform through Web3 technology that includes not only gaming elements but also integrates social interaction and financial empowerment. Fun Worlds is an open digital world where players can freely explore, communicate, collaborate, and even participate in ecosystem governance. Every participant is a part of this ecosystem, and every interaction contributes to the whole system.

Here, we value the smoothness and accessibility of the player experience. To this end, we have optimized the network infrastructure to ensure that transaction speeds and costs meet the community‚Äôs needs. Fun Worlds‚Äô technology choices allow us to maintain decentralization while providing a first-class gaming experience to players.

Fun Worlds is more than a game; it is a community, a land of opportunity. It is a platform where players can enjoy the fun of gaming while participating in a potential financial market. In this social gaming world, every player has the opportunity to become a creator, explorer, and leader.

We invite you to join Fun Worlds, to usher in an era of innovation, interaction, and value creation in Web3 gaming. Let us witness the new chapter of social gaming in the decentralized era together.

# [\[TEP-111\] Enhancing Blockchain Asset Management: Introducing NFT Burning Functionality to TON](/t/tep-111-enhancing-blockchain-asset-management-introducing-nft-burning-functionality-to-ton/183)

## [](#overview-1)Overview

This technical document outlines a proposal for introducing NFT (Non-Fungible Token) burning functionality within the TON blockchain ecosystem. The primary goal is to address the challenges associated with asset duplication and storage inefficiency, especially concerning NFTs that traverse between chains. By implementing a standardized approach to NFT burning, this proposal seeks to ensure the integrity of digital assets and optimize blockchain storage.

## [](#proposal-information-2)Proposal Information

*   **TEP (TON Enhancement Proposal)**: TEP Template
*   **Title**: Enhancing Blockchain Asset Management: Introducing NFT Burning Functionality to TON
*   **Status**: Draft
*   **Type**: Contract Interface
*   **Authors**: Dima Brook
*   **Creation Date**: 07.02.2023
*   **Replaces**: TEP-62
*   **Replaced by**: TEP-63

## [](#rationale-3)Rationale

The motivation behind this proposal stems from the need to manage NFTs effectively as they are minted, transferred, or bridged across different blockchain platforms. Specifically, it aims to prevent:

1.  **Asset Duplication and Double Spending**: Ensuring a single, consistent state of an NFT across multiple chains.
2.  **Inaccurate Display by Marketplaces and Explorers**: Avoiding the representation of non-existent or inoperable tokens.
3.  **Unnecessary Storage Consumption**: Reducing the footprint of obsolete data within the blockchain‚Äôs nodes.

To achieve these objectives, the proposal outlines a method for securely and efficiently burning NFTs that are no longer required or have been moved back to their original chain or another foreign chain.

## [](#implementation-guide-4)Implementation Guide

The process involves two primary actions:

1.  **Destruction of NFT Contracts**: Contracts holding the NFT must be irrevocably destroyed, and all associated records within the collection smart contract must be either removed or nullified.
2.  **Asset Marking**: As an interim solution, assets can be marked as ‚ÄúBURNED‚Äù to be filtered out by marketplaces and explorers. However, this does not address the issue of storage optimization.

## [](#drawbacks-and-security-6)Drawbacks and Security

The proposal acknowledges potential drawbacks, including the risk of malicious burning actions. It suggests implementing robust security mechanisms to safeguard against unauthorized destruction of assets. Additionally, maintaining chain history‚Äôs integrity is emphasized, recommending that burning transactions be recorded to ensure a comprehensive and consistent blockchain ledger.

## [](#rationale-alternatives-and-prior-art-7)Rationale, Alternatives, and Prior Art

The document contrasts the proposed NFT burning functionality with existing alternatives, such as transferring tokens to a ‚Äúdead‚Äù address, highlighting the superiority of the proposed method in preventing asset duplication and confusion with semi-fungible tokens (SFTs). It references prior implementations like the EVM OpenZeppelin Burnable Extension as a foundation for developing a standardized approach within the TON ecosystem.

## [](#unresolved-questions-and-future-directions-8)Unresolved Questions and Future Directions

Several questions remain open, including the need to update the TEP-62 standard to incorporate burning functionality and the requirement for NFT marketplaces and explorers to adapt to the updated standard. The document also opens the door to future considerations, such as the integration of SFTs into the standard to accommodate assets with identical metadata but differing ownership or characteristics.

## [](#conclusion-9)Conclusion

This proposal sets the stage for a significant enhancement in managing digital assets within the TON blockchain. By introducing a standardized NFT burning functionality, it aims to streamline asset management, enhance security, and optimize storage, thereby contributing to the overall efficiency and integrity of the blockchain ecosystem.

_Who are your competitors? Are there any similar existing solutions on TON? If yes, mention similar solutions and elaborate on your product‚Äôs advantages._

_Our project faces competition from both existing language learning apps and newer blockchain-integrated projects. While there are several language learning platforms that utilize game mechanics, our project distinguishes itself by integrating the TON blockchain, which allows for a Learn 2 Earn model. This model not only incentivizes learning through crypto rewards but also promotes real-time language practice and cultural exchange within a global community. To the best of our knowledge, there are no similar solutions currently available on TON, positioning our project uniquely at the intersection of language learning and blockchain technology._

_Please describe your user acquisition strategy_

_Our user acquisition strategy for the WordBooX game is multi-faceted, focusing on partnerships with language schools and educational institutions to leverage their networks for direct user engagement. We plan to utilize social media marketing, specifically targeting language learning and gaming communities to raise awareness and mini app users. Additionally, we will implement referral programs that reward users for inviting their friends, further enhancing organic growth. Influencer collaborations and targeted ads will also be employed to reach potential users interested in both web 3.0 gaming and language learning._

_Who is your target user?_

_Our target user is a language learner who enjoys gamified educational experiences. Specifically, we focus on individuals of various age groups who are seeking to improve or start learning a new language and are interested in using technology to enhance their learning experience. This includes students, professionals, and casual learners who are motivated by the integration of learning with technology and the incentive of earning while they learn. We aim to attract users who are active in online communities related to language learning and WEB 3.0 gaming, offering them a unique blend of education and entertainment._

_What is your vision on further funding steps once your grant scope is complete?_

_Once the grant scope is complete, our vision for further funding involves seeking additional grants and venture capital investment to scale the project. We plan to leverage the initial traction and results achieved during the grant period to demonstrate the viability and potential of our project to investors. Additionally, we aim to explore strategic partnerships within the language learning and blockchain communities to enhance our platform‚Äôs capabilities and reach. This combined approach will ensure sustainable growth and continuous development of our project._

_Overview of the technology stack to be used_

_The technology stack for the project consist of the TON blockchain for implementing decentralized functionalities and ensuring secure, transparent transactions. The application‚Äôs frontend developed using modern frameworks such as React or Vue.js, optimized for performance and responsiveness. The backend utilize Node.js for efficient server-side logic, along with express frameworks to handle API requests seamlessly. For database management we used mySQL. This combination ensures a robust, scalable, and maintainable infrastructure._

# [\[TEP-105\] Standardizing the Web3 Provider Interface in TON: A JavaScript API Proposal](/t/tep-105-standardizing-the-web3-provider-interface-in-ton-a-javascript-api-proposal/184)

[Application](/c/application/20) 

[tep](https://tonresear.ch/tag/tep), [api](https://tonresear.ch/tag/api)

    

[doge](https://tonresear.ch/u/doge)  February 4, 2024, 11:17am  1

## [](#abstract-1)Abstract

This document proposes a standardized JavaScript API for Web3 providers on the TON blockchain, aiming to ensure consistency and interoperability across clients and decentralized applications (DApps). By formalizing the Web3 Provider API, this TEP (TON Enhancement Proposal) seeks to establish a common convention for wallet software to expose their API via a JavaScript object in web pages, enhancing the developer experience and facilitating user interaction with DApps.

## [](#proposal-information-2)Proposal Information

*   **TEP (TON Enhancement Proposal)**: 0
*   **Title**: Standardizing the Web3 Provider Interface in TON: A JavaScript API Proposal
*   **Status**: Draft
*   **Type**: Core
*   **Authors**: XTON Wallet Team
*   **Creation Date**: 19.12.2022
*   **Replaces**: TEP-0
*   **Replaced by**: None

## [](#motivation-3)Motivation

The main goal of this proposal is to establish a uniform Web3 provider interface, preventing the monopolization of wallet services and enabling DApps to integrate with multiple wallet solutions seamlessly. Inspired by successful implementations in other blockchains, such as Ethereum‚Äôs MetaMask, this proposal introduces `window.ton` as the uniform interface for Web3 providers on the TON blockchain.

## [](#specification-4)Specification

The specification outlines the structure of the proposed API, emphasizing minimalism, event-driven architecture, and transport agnosticism. It also introduces backward compatibility and extensibility through versioning, with `windows.ton.isTEPs105` indicating full API compliance.

### [](#comparison-table-current-vs-proposed-api-features-5)Comparison Table: Current vs. Proposed API Features

Feature

Current Implementation

Proposed Standardization

Interface Exposure

Inconsistent across wallets

Unified as `window.ton`

Versioning

Not standardized

Standardized with `isTEPs` property

Request Handling

Diverse, wallet-specific

Standardized `Provider.request` method

Event Handling

Varies widely

Standardized events: `on`, `off`, `message`, `endpointChanged`, `accountChanged`, `unlockStateChanged`

RPC Methods

Wallet-specific implementations

Standardized naming and handling

Subscriptions

Inconsistently supported

Standardized with `ton_subscription` event

Error Handling

Diverse, not standardized

Standardized `ProviderRpcError` with defined codes

## [](#security-considerations-6)Security Considerations

The proposal emphasizes the Provider‚Äôs role as a bridge between TON Clients and DApps, not handling private key management but focusing on processing RPC messages and emitting events. It stresses the importance of treating the Provider object as potentially controlled by adversaries, highlighting the need for protective measures in the Wallet and Client against malicious actions.

## [](#drawbacks-and-rationale-7)Drawbacks and Rationale

While existing wallets have their implementations of the Web3 interface, adopting this standardized API would require them to support both the new standard and their existing interfaces. The proposal justifies its approach by pointing to the success of similar standards in other blockchain ecosystems, arguing for the benefits of a unified and interoperable interface.

## [](#unresolved-questions-and-future-possibilities-8)Unresolved Questions and Future Possibilities

The document raises questions about the willingness of existing wallet solutions to adopt this standardized interface and suggests potential future extensions to include SDK method usage, enhancing the DApp development experience further.

## [](#conclusion-9)Conclusion

This TEP proposes a significant step toward standardizing the Web3 provider interface within the TON blockchain ecosystem. By adopting a uniform API, the proposal aims to simplify DApp development, enhance user experience, and foster an environment of interoperability and innovation among wallet providers and DApps.

### [](#appendix-and-additional-resources-10)Appendix and Additional Resources

The proposal includes appendices detailing the API‚Äôs consumer-facing documentation, examples of usage, and a comprehensive list of supported functions and events. These resources are designed to assist developers in integrating the standardized Web3 provider into their applications, ensuring a smooth transition to a more unified and efficient ecosystem.

Buying keys now would enable you to be part of the initial minting of $TOS tokens, each key will enable you to earn $TOS as if you are staking. There is also an on-going airdrop for wallets with 100+ TON, with a random airdrop value between 20k - 500k $TOS.

Secure your access key!

This project is SCAM.

They announced several partnerships, most of them are fake.  
CCA GROUP partner is not even on any social, totally unknown. I have been banned for asking infos about them.

Other 2 partners, their project is dead, asked them to prove partnership with TonSquare, they banned me from their Twitter (Avisa Games and CoinNerd).

TonSquare TG channel is the typical hype channel owned by bots and 2 silly moderators (Mohammed and Bruno), hyping each other while users asking for infos are muted or banned.

Beware, DO NOT BUY ACESS KEYS.

# [\[TEP-104\] Enhancing Security in Non-Transaction Data Signing within the TON Ecosystem](/t/tep-104-enhancing-security-in-non-transaction-data-signing-within-the-ton-ecosystem/185)

[Application](/c/application/ton-connect/42)  [TON Connect](/c/application/ton-connect/42) 

[tep](https://tonresear.ch/tag/tep)

    

[doge](https://tonresear.ch/u/doge)  February 4, 2024, 11:19am  1

**Abstract**

This document introduces a protocol designed to ensure safe and verifiable signing of non-transaction data using wallet keys within the TON (The Open Network) ecosystem. The protocol, identified as Data Signatures, proposes a method for wallets to sign arbitrary data, distinguishing these signatures from transactional signatures to mitigate misuse and replay attacks.

**Introduction**

In the TON ecosystem, wallets serve dual functions: managing assets and acting as universal identifiers across applications. While the primary use case involves signing transactions for coin transfers or smart contract interactions, there exists a need for wallets to authenticate non-transactional data for off-chain and on-chain applications without compromising security.

**Proposal Summary**

*   **TEP**: [0](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/pull/0)
*   **Status**: Draft
*   **Type**: Core
*   **Authors**: Oleg Andreev, Sergey Andreev, Denis Subbotin
*   **Creation Date**: 13.12.2022
*   **Replaces**: [TEP-0](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/0000-template.md)

**Objective**

To enable the TON wallets to sign arbitrary non-transaction data securely, ensuring the signatures are distinctly separable from transaction signatures to prevent misuse.

**Methodology**

The proposal details a signature scheme for arbitrary data, incorporating a unique composition of schema identifier, timestamp, and payload hash to create domain-separated signatures.

**Implementation Details**

**Component**

**Specification**

Signing Data

352-bit message combining schema CRC, timestamp, and payload hash

Verification

Enforcing domain separation through schema CRC, payload content, and timestamp

Payload

Arbitrary data structured per TL-B definition

Security

Domain separation ensured by unique schema versions and timestamp binding

**Schema Versions**

1.  **Short plain text message**: For signing UTF-8 text, utilizing the `plaintext` schema.
2.  **Application binding**: Allows signing data specifically for target applications, identified by TON.DNS names or contract addresses.

**Security Considerations**

The proposal outlines measures for binding signatures to specific applications and timeframes to mitigate replay attacks and ensure domain separation.

**Comparison with Existing Solutions**

**Feature**

**Data Signatures Proposal**

**Ethereum EIP-1271**

Domain Separation

Schema CRC and timestamp

Signature validation method

Payload Flexibility

Arbitrary data via TL-B

Pre-defined formats

Signature Replay Safety

Timestamp binding

Not specified

Application Binding

TON.DNS and contract addresses

Not applicable

**Conclusion**

The Data Signatures protocol presents a comprehensive framework for securely signing non-transaction data within the TON ecosystem. By establishing a clear separation between transactional and non-transactional signatures, it offers enhanced security for both off-chain and on-chain applications, paving the way for a more versatile and secure digital identity and authentication system within the TON network.

This proposal is an evolution of @ex3ndr's \[safe-signing proposal\](https://githu[‚Ä¶](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/pull/104)b.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/pull/93). Highlights: \* "Invalid cell representation" trick is not necessary because we are signing a differently-sized message. \* Separate schemas for plaintext messages and binary messages. User can explicitly check all the data they are signing. \* Mandatory binding to a timestamp. \* Support for binding to smart contract address and domain name. \* Possibility for future extensions with detailed schemas retaining backwards compatibility with the wallets. Rendered specification: \* \[üìÑ TEP: Data Signatures\](https://github.com/oleganza/TEPs/blob/datasig/text/0000-data-signatures.md)

[Application](/c/application/jetton/26)  [Jetton](/c/application/jetton/26)

[doge](https://tonresear.ch/u/doge)  February 4, 2024, 11:22am  1

### [](#introduction-1)Introduction

The evolution of the TON blockchain ecosystem has led to the development of various asset standards, notably TEP-74 and TEP-89, which govern the creation and interaction of jettons. However, the interaction between the native TON currency and these jettons remains fragmented due to the lack of a universally adopted mechanism for wrapping TON (WTON). This document proposes a standardized, secure, and efficient implementation of a Wrapped TON (WTON) contract to facilitate seamless interaction between TON and jettons, thereby unifying asset interaction within the TON ecosystem.

### [](#motivation-2)Motivation

The primary motivation behind the introduction of a universal WTON is to streamline and unify asset interactions on the TON blockchain. Currently, the existence of multiple wrapped TON implementations, such as wTON and jTON, poses significant risks including financial vulnerabilities, ecosystem fragmentation, and inconsistency in features. A universally adopted WTON standard addresses these concerns by providing a single, secure, and consistent API for developers, reducing financial risks, and ensuring feature parity across the ecosystem.

### [](#implementation-overview-3)Implementation Overview

The proposed WTON implementation is based on the TEP-89 standard but introduces additional logic for transaction pipelines during minting (wrapping) and burning (unwrapping) processes. This implementation enables users to wrap TON into WTON and vice versa with enhanced security and efficiency. The core functionalities of this implementation include:

*   **Wrapping:** Securely locks TON 1-to-1 on mint, allowing for transaction pipelines through `forward_amount` and `forward_payload`.
*   **Unwrapping:** Releases TON on burn, with provisions for custom payloads to facilitate extended interactions.

### [](#technical-specification-4)Technical Specification

The WTON contract adheres to the TEP-74 and TEP-89 standards, incorporating specific operations for enhanced functionality. These operations include `burn_notification_ext`, `mint`, and `release`, designed to support complex transaction sequences and ensure secure and efficient interaction with jettons.

#### [](#wrapping-and-unwrapping-process-5)Wrapping and Unwrapping Process

The process of wrapping and unwrapping TON involves a series of steps designed to ensure security, efficiency, and user convenience. These steps include validation checks, transaction pipeline construction, and adherence to minimal balance requirements. The implementation facilitates the seamless transition of TON to WTON and vice versa, leveraging the capabilities of the TON blockchain for broader asset interactions.

### [](#comparative-analysis-6)Comparative Analysis

The proposed WTON implementation offers several advantages over existing approaches, including the reduction of transaction complexity, cost savings through the avoidance of multiple contract interactions, and the provision of a unified API for asset interaction. A comparative analysis with alternative approaches, such as direct use of TEP-74/TEP-89 standards without modifications, reveals the superiority of the proposed standard in terms of efficiency, security, and user experience.

### [](#conclusion-7)Conclusion

The introduction of a universal Wrapped TON standard represents a significant advancement in the unification of asset interactions within the TON blockchain ecosystem. By adopting a secure, efficient, and universally compatible WTON implementation, developers and users alike can benefit from streamlined transactions, reduced financial risks, and a cohesive ecosystem experience. The proposed standard not only addresses the current challenges of asset interaction but also lays the foundation for future innovations and integrations within the TON ecosystem.

Web3 is one of those very young and underestimated projects directly impacting the popularity of TON, moving users from web2 to web3 realm, increasing the overall TVL of the system in several ways at once and having unlimited potential. As an example for comparison, the success of telegram anonymous numbers and telegram usernames and its popularity after launch of Fragment site comes to mind. Same dynamics awaits us with web3 token and domains after the launch of ton browser and all TON DNS related utilities.

# [\[TEP-101\] Enhancing Privacy and Usability in TON with Deterministic Subwallets](/t/tep-101-enhancing-privacy-and-usability-in-ton-with-deterministic-subwallets/187)

[TON Blockchain](/c/ton-blockchain/17)

### [](#introduction-1)Introduction

The TON blockchain, known for its scalability and speed, faces a challenge common to many digital asset platforms: the need for enhanced privacy and usability in wallet management. This technical document introduces a proposal for deterministic subwallets, aiming to streamline the creation and management of multiple wallets from a single seed, thereby improving both privacy and user experience.

### [](#background-2)Background

Users of digital assets often require multiple wallets to manage their assets for various purposes. Each new wallet necessitates separate backup procedures, complicating the management process. The proposed standard, documented as TEP-0, addresses this challenge by enabling the creation of multiple, privacy-preserving subaccounts or subwallets from a single mnemonic seed, making them indistinguishable from randomly generated wallets.

### [](#motivation-3)Motivation

The primary motivation behind this proposal is to simplify the user experience in managing multiple wallets and enhance privacy. By allowing users to generate numerous independent wallets as subaccounts from a single mnemonic, the need for repeated backups with each new wallet creation is eliminated. This approach significantly improves usability and ensures privacy, as the public keys of these subwallets cannot be linked to a single owner without access to the private keys.

### [](#technical-specification-4)Technical Specification

The process of generating subwallet keys involves several steps, detailed below, and adheres to specific standards and practices to ensure security and functionality:

1.  **Initial Mnemonic Conversion**: The user‚Äôs mnemonic is converted into entropy using HMAC-SHA512.
2.  **Subwallet Generation**: This entropy is then combined with a subwallet identifier using HMAC-SHA512, resulting in a `seed_level0`.
3.  **Final Seed Derivation**: The `seed_level0` undergoes PBKDF2-SHA512 hashing with the salt ‚ÄúTON default seed‚Äù and 10,000 iterations, with the first 32 bytes of the result serving as the wallet‚Äôs private key.

These steps ensure that each subwallet is securely derived from the initial mnemonic, providing a privacy-preserving mechanism for managing multiple wallets.

### [](#implementation-guidelines-5)Implementation Guidelines

Wallet applications implementing this standard must adhere to specific guidelines to ensure consistency and security:

*   **Subwallet Identifiers**: Applications must use a decimal representation of consecutive numbers starting with 0 for subwallet identifiers, with provisions for user-defined or randomly generated identifiers for additional privacy.
*   **Asset Display**: Applications should display assets separately for each subwallet, with an optional aggregate view for the user‚Äôs convenience.
*   **Subwallet Creation**: A recommended function, `subwalletMnemonicToSeed`, should be defined in relevant libraries to streamline the creation process.

### [](#comparative-analysis-6)Comparative Analysis

Feature

Deterministic Subwallets

Traditional Multi-Wallet Management

Backup Process

Single mnemonic backup for all subwallets

Separate backup required for each wallet

Privacy

Enhanced, as subwallets are indistinguishable from random wallets

Limited, as each wallet is independently generated

Usability

Simplified management with a single seed

Complex management with multiple seeds

Security

High, with HMAC-SHA512 and PBKDF2-SHA512 for key derivation

Varies, depending on the implementation

### [](#conclusion-7)Conclusion

The deterministic subwallet standard proposed in TEP-0 offers a significant improvement in privacy and usability for TON users managing multiple wallets. By streamlining the wallet creation process from a single mnemonic seed, users benefit from enhanced security, simplified backup procedures, and improved privacy, making it a valuable addition to the TON ecosystem‚Äôs tools for asset management.

Hello all TON enthusiasts, you must be familiar with us

We are building a quality and degen community on TON to ensure benefits for all participants. So who are those subjects?

1.  Users: We always ensure to give users the best experience: News about TON and projects on TON, opportunity to receive airdrops from the project, understand more about how to interact with TON Blockchain, etc.
2.  Projects: We provide comprehensive support for projects, especially new and quality projects. Not only Marketing and Community Building, we also support project development, especially dev on TON.
3.  TON Foundation: We plan to organize offline events at our local area, deploy courses to help on-board add more quality users and developers to the TON Blockchain.

So what do we want to propose here?

Besides being a simple community, we are developing tools to help the project more easily develop its marketing and community, making it easier for users to interact with TON Blockchain.

Therefore, we are wondering about launching our token - $TDEGEN to achieve our goals.

Launching the token will not be for profit purposes but will focus on creating a community where the rights of holders are guaranteed, creating fairness and civilization for all members of the community. We can assign a reputable third party to audit this part.

What do you think about this idea?

We are always aiming for decentralization so please let us know if you support this idea or not!

# [\[TEP-92\] Establishing a Wallet Registry on TON Blockchain for Dynamic Wallet Integration](/t/tep-92-establishing-a-wallet-registry-on-ton-blockchain-for-dynamic-wallet-integration/188)

[TON Blockchain](/c/ton-blockchain/17) 

[tep](https://tonresear.ch/tag/tep)

    

[doge](https://tonresear.ch/u/doge)  February 4, 2024, 11:26am  1

### [](#introduction-1)Introduction

In the rapidly evolving TON ecosystem, the establishment of a wallet registry represents a significant advancement towards streamlining the integration of various wallet providers with decentralized applications (DApps). This document introduces a standardized approach to maintain an on-chain registry that holds a list of wallet providers, such as TonKeeper and TonHub. The primary goal is to enable DApp clients, such as those for decentralized exchanges (DEX) or NFT marketplaces, to query this list dynamically for populating the ‚ÄúConnect Wallet‚Äù interface, thereby enhancing user experience and fostering a more inclusive and competitive wallet ecosystem.

### [](#motivation-2)Motivation

Currently, TON DApp developers face challenges in integrating multiple wallet providers due to the diverse connection methods supported by each wallet. This fragmentation necessitates bespoke integrations for each provider, hindering the adoption of new wallets and potentially centralizing the wallet landscape, as observed in the Ethereum ecosystem with MetaMask. The proposed wallet registry aims to democratize wallet integration, allowing for easier inclusion of new wallet providers and facilitating seamless wallet updates and rebranding without disrupting existing DApp functionalities.

### [](#implementation-overview-3)Implementation Overview

The wallet registry is envisioned as a smart contract deployed on the TON mainnet, which stores a list of TON DNS names for participating wallet providers. Wallet providers are required to register their TON DNS names with the registry and advertise their connection details, such as backend servers or deeplinks, as TON DNS records. This approach ensures that DApp clients can access a current and comprehensive list of wallet providers, along with their connection information, to populate the ‚ÄúConnect Wallet‚Äù interface dynamically.

### [](#technical-specification-4)Technical Specification

#### [](#wallet-registry-contract-5)Wallet Registry Contract

*   The wallet registry contract maintains a list of TON DNS names in its storage, accessible through specific contract actions for registration and retrieval.
*   A deposit mechanism is proposed to mitigate spam, requiring wallet providers to lock a certain amount of TON Coin upon registration, refundable upon deregistration.
*   The contract supports querying the registered wallets, potentially implementing efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms such as dictionaries or linked lists.

#### [](#wallet-provider-records-6)Wallet Provider Records

*   Wallet providers must register their TON DNS names and specify connection details through TON DNS records, including name, description, logo, and supported platforms.
*   Additional attributes may be required for different connection protocols, such as TonConnect and ton-x, including server URLs and mobile deeplinks.

### [](#comparative-analysis-7)Comparative Analysis

Feature

Proposed Wallet Registry

Traditional Integration Approach

**Integration Effort**

Low; DApps query a single on-chain registry

High; DApps must individually integrate each wallet

**Wallet Inclusion**

Dynamic; New wallets can be easily added to the registry

Static; Adding a new wallet requires DApp updates

**Update Flexibility**

High; Wallets can update their details without affecting DApps

Low; Updates may require DApps to redeploy clients

**Ecosystem Centralization**

Reduced; Facilitates competition and diversity

Increased; Favours dominant wallets like MetaMask in Ethereum

### [](#conclusion-8)Conclusion

The introduction of an on-chain wallet registry on the TON blockchain represents a forward-thinking solution to the challenges of wallet integration faced by DApp developers. By centralizing wallet information in a dynamically queryable registry, the TON ecosystem can foster a more competitive and decentralized wallet landscape, improving user experience and promoting innovation. The proposed registry not only simplifies the integration process for developers but also ensures that users have access to a broad and up-to-date selection of wallet providers, marking a significant step towards a more open and accessible TON ecosystem.

Will address of smart contract remain same after sharding ?

  2 Likes

[yc\_msg](https://tonresear.ch/u/yc_msg) July 18, 2024, 11:03am  2

Absolutely, the address of a smart contract in the TON blockchain remains unchanged after sharding. Sharding is designed to scale the network by dividing it into shardchains, but it doesn‚Äôt alter the unique addresses of smart contracts. These addresses are composed of a workchain ID and an intra-workchain address, ensuring consistency across the network‚Äôs structure.

For a deeper dive into TON‚Äôs sharding mechanisms, check out these resources:

*   [Sharding Overview](https://docs.ton.org/develop/blockchain/shards)
    
*   [Blockchain Fundamentals](https://docs.ton.org/develop/blockchain/shards)
    
*   [Infinity Sharding Paradigm](https://docs.ton.org/develop/blockchain/sharding-lifecycle)
    

When deploying a smart contract, its address can be pre-calculated, allowing it to receive funds and messages even before it‚Äôs activated. Activation is simply the process of deploying the contract with a deploy message. Learn more about smart contract deployment and address activation here:

Chick Coop Game bot officially launched at 8:50pm UTC on May 21, 2024, within 12 hours it reached 18k Active Users.

With the above growth figures, I believe that despite its young age and recent launch, Chick Coop deserves to participate in The Open League and will be a strong contender for high-ranking positions on the leaderboard.  
It will also bring a fresh breeze, excitement, and strong competition between new and old projects in the Ton Blockchain ecosystem.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about us. From Chick Coop with love.

By submitting the form I confirm that the data I provided is correct and I fully understand that in case of the contrary, my project will be permanently eliminated from The Open League

# [\[TEP-91\] Introducing a Decentralized Contract Source Registry on TON Blockchain](/t/tep-91-introducing-a-decentralized-contract-source-registry-on-ton-blockchain/189)

[TON Blockchain](/c/ton-blockchain/17) 

[tep](https://tonresear.ch/tag/tep)

    

[doge](https://tonresear.ch/u/doge)  February 4, 2024, 11:28am  1

### [](#introduction-1)Introduction

The TON blockchain, like many others, operates on the principle that ‚Äúcode is law,‚Äù with smart contracts acting as the binding agreements between parties. However, the on-chain storage of smart contracts in compiled TVM bitcode form poses a significant challenge for human readability and transparency. Recognizing the importance of accessible and verifiable source code, this document proposes a decentralized infrastructure and an on-chain registry dedicated to storing the source code of verified TON smart contracts. This approach not only enhances transparency and trust within the TON ecosystem but also aligns with the blockchain‚Äôs principles of decentralization and open access.

### [](#motivation-2)Motivation

The ability for users to read and understand the terms of smart contracts they interact with is crucial for informed participation in the blockchain ecosystem. Currently, the absence of a standardized, accessible platform for source code verification hinders users‚Äô ability to verify the functionality and safety of smart contracts. By establishing a decentralized registry for contract source codes, we aim to address these challenges, ensuring that the TON ecosystem remains open, transparent, and secure for all participants.

### [](#implementation-overview-3)Implementation Overview

The proposed contract source registry operates through a collaborative protocol involving various stakeholders within the TON community, including contract developers, source-code uploaders, verifiers, displayers, and end users. The registry leverages IPFS (and eventually TON Storage) for storing human-readable source files and on-chain contracts to map code hashes to their respective source files. This system facilitates a permissionless verification process, allowing for greater transparency and accountability in smart contract deployment and operation.

### [](#technical-specification-4)Technical Specification

#### [](#contract-source-registry-components-5)Contract Source Registry Components

*   **IPFS and TON Storage**: Used for storing the human-readable source-code files and verification attestations due to their potentially large size and cost implications of on-chain storage.
*   **On-chain Registry Contracts**: Deployed to the TON mainnet to map code hash values of contracts to the URLs hosting their source codes, facilitating easy access and verification.

Everything TONK has accomplished (so far) is amazing. Setting a strong foundation for the project and always updating the members in full transparency is a must in a newer project. They have delivered more than most. To the point that some projects have already copied some utilities. That‚Äôs speaks volume.

**NotTGR** is a utility token within the Tegro ecosystem, designed to boost activity and transactions across various platforms, including the gaming bot and the exchange.

The token offers unique opportunities due to its flexible smart contract that allows minting new tokens and a well-thought-out economic structure.

NotTGR holders can use it to participate in events, airdrops, and complete various tasks while maintaining its liquidity and value.

**Project Description and Token Utility for NotTGR**

**Project Overview:** NotTGR is a versatile utility token within the Tegro ecosystem, specifically designed to enhance user engagement and facilitate transactions across multiple platforms. This includes our innovative gaming bot and the Tegro.Finance exchange. By leveraging a flexible smart contract, NotTGR allows for the minting of new tokens, ensuring continuous growth and adaptability within the ecosystem.

**Token Utility:**

1.  **Event Participation and Airdrops:** NotTGR is used as a key token for participating in various events and receiving airdrops within the Tegro ecosystem. This drives user engagement and rewards active community members.
2.  **Task Completion in Gaming Bot:** Users can earn NotTGR by completing tasks and missions within our [gaming bot](https://t.me/TegroTONbot/game). This gamified approach not only makes the earning process enjoyable but also promotes consistent user interaction.
3.  **Exchange Liquidity:** The Tegro team ensures the liquidity of NotTGR by continuously adding to its liquidity pools and facilitating its listing on centralized exchanges. This provides users with multiple avenues to trade and utilize their tokens.
4.  **Seamless Token Swap:** NotTGR can be easily swapped for the primary TGR token via [our exchange](https://tegro.finance/swap). This interoperability between tokens adds an extra layer of flexibility for users within the ecosystem.
5.  **Unlimited Supply:** Unlike the primary TGR token, which is capped at 50 million tokens, NotTGR has an unlimited supply. This ensures that there are always enough tokens to meet the demands of the growing Tegro community.
6.  **Staking for Rewards:** Users can stake NotTGR pairs on cryptocurrency exchanges to earn additional cryptocurrency rewards. This staking option provides an attractive way for users to generate passive income while supporting the ecosystem‚Äôs liquidity.

**Conclusion:** NotTGR complements TGR by providing a dynamic and flexible utility token that enhances the overall functionality and user experience within the Tegro ecosystem. Whether it‚Äôs through participating in events, earning through gaming, staking for rewards, or trading on exchanges, NotTGR offers diverse opportunities for users to engage and benefit from the Tegro platform.

### [](#introduction-1)Introduction

The development of smart contracts on the TON blockchain, utilizing the FunC programming language, presents unique challenges in terms of project management and tool integration. To streamline development workflows and enhance tool compatibility, this proposal introduces a standardized project configuration file for FunC projects, analogous to widely recognized configuration files like `project.json` in .NET, `Cargo.toml` in Rust, and others.

### [](#motivation-2)Motivation

The absence of a universal project configuration leads to inefficiencies in the development process. Developers resort to using bash scripts or manual setups for compiler configurations and tool integrations, which is not only cumbersome but also error-prone. A standardized configuration file aims to simplify project setup, compiler configuration, and tool integration, thereby improving the overall development experience on the TON blockchain.

### [](#implementation-overview-3)Implementation Overview

The proposed configuration file, potentially named `.func.yml`, is designed to be extensible and stack-agnostic, catering to a wide range of development tools and environments. The initial implementation focuses on essential project specifications, including entry points, source directories, library dependencies, and compiler settings. The format‚Äôs extensibility allows for future additions and custom tool-specific configurations.

### [](#technical-specification-4)Technical Specification

#### [](#proposed-configuration-structure-5)Proposed Configuration Structure

Key

Description

`compiler`

Specifies the compiler version and other relevant settings.

`sources`

Defines the root source folder for the project, facilitating source code discovery and indexing.

`entrypoints`

Lists the main contract files within the project, serving as starting points for compilation and deployment.

`libraries`

Outlines directories containing third-party libraries or dependencies, enhancing discoverability and integration.

`custom`

Allows for tool-specific configurations, providing flexibility and extensibility to meet diverse tooling requirements.

#### [](#example-configuration-6)Example Configuration

```
compiler: 
    version: 0.2.0
sources: src/
entrypoints:
    - contracts/nft.fc
    - contracts/nft-collection.fc
libraries:
    - node_modules/func-*
```

### [](#comparative-analysis-7)Comparative Analysis

Feature

Without Standardized Config

With `.func.yml` Configuration

Project Setup

Manual and error-prone

Streamlined and standardized, enhancing ease of setup

Compiler Configuration

Requires bash scripts or manual setup

Centralized and easily customizable within the config file

Tool Integration

Inconsistent and requires separate configurations

Unified under a single configuration file, improving tool compatibility and development workflows

Project Portability

Low due to scattered and non-standard setups

High, thanks to a standardized configuration that can be easily shared and replicated across development environments

### [](#conclusion-8)Conclusion

The introduction of a standardized project configuration file for FunC projects represents a significant leap forward in simplifying and enhancing the TON blockchain development experience. By adopting `.func.yml`, developers can enjoy a more cohesive, efficient, and enjoyable development process, paving the way for greater innovation and collaboration within the TON ecosystem. As the ecosystem evolves, this configuration format is poised to adapt, accommodating new compiler features and expanding tooling landscapes.

 **![:red_square:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/red_square.png?v=12 ":red_square:") PocketFi reached 2 million users and completed halving: Mining Speed is reduced by half**

PocketFi‚Äôs team announced that app surpassed the 2 million user milestone!

Starting from that point, the basic mining speed, new referral bonuses, and boosts (except for $PUNK burn) are all halved.

*   **TON swaps:** 8 switch/h ‚ûû 4 switch/h
    
*   **EVM swaps:** 5 switch/h ‚ûû 2,5 switch/h
    
*   **ETH swaps:** 12 switch/h ‚ûû 6 switch/h
    
*   **$PUNK Burn:** 9 switch/h (unaffected, 11 days left until it disappears from Boosts tab)
    
*   **New referrals:** up to 240 switch per user ‚ûû up to 120 switch per user.
    

After next halving this rewards will be halved again. You can monitor current user count and $switch emission on [dashboard.pocketfi.org](http://dashboard.pocketfi.org)

### [](#what-is-bemo-1)What is BeMo?

BeMo is a pioneering non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on The Open Network (TON) blockchain. As the first liquid staking application on TON, BeMo allows users to stake their native TON tokens and receive stTON tokens in return. These stTON tokens can be freely utilized within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, providing flexibility and additional opportunities for users to maximize their investments.

The value of stTON tokens increases relative to TON as staking rewards accumulate after each validation round facilitated by the BeMo protocol. This innovative approach ensures that users benefit from the staking process while maintaining liquidity.

### [](#who-is-behind-bemo-2)Who is Behind BeMo?

BeMo is the brainchild of a diverse and skilled team comprising traditional finance professionals, blockchain experts, and software developers. This team shares a unified vision of creating investment products that deliver value to all users, whether they are newcomers or seasoned blockchain enthusiasts.

The smart contracts powering BeMo were developed by the same team behind Fanzee, an innovative sports fan engagement platform and the first retail project launched on the TON blockchain. With over seven years of experience in building blockchain platforms and applications, this team ensures that BeMo operates with the highest standards of security and efficiency.

### [](#how-bemo-works-3)How BeMo Works

#### [](#protocol-overview-4)Protocol Overview

BeMo‚Äôs functionality is governed by a set of smart contracts on the TON blockchain. These contracts handle various essential tasks, including:

*   TON deposits and withdrawals
*   Minting and burning of stTON tokens
*   Transfer of TON tokens to participating validators
*   Receipt of staking fees
*   Validation and protocol fee calculation and distribution
*   stTON vs. TON price and exchange rate calculation

The key components of BeMo are the application‚Äôs smart contracts and the stTON token, which together facilitate a seamless staking experience.

#### [](#staking-5)Staking

To stake their tokens, users utilize the ‚ÄòStake‚Äô function within the BeMo application. Upon confirming the TON deposit transaction through their wallet, users receive stTON tokens. These tokens represent their share in the application‚Äôs TON token pool.

The number of stTON tokens received is determined by the smart contract‚Äôs algorithm, which considers the user‚Äôs staked TON amount and the current stTON/TON exchange rate.

#### [](#validation-6)Validation

Once the TON tokens are pooled in the smart contract, they are distributed among participating validating nodes. These nodes participate in validation rounds to approve TON blockchain transactions and earn network rewards.

After each validation round, the rewards (minus a service fee) are added directly to the BeMo TON token pool, enhancing its value. As the pool‚Äôs value increases, so does the TON price of stTON, reflecting users‚Äô growing shares in the pool.

#### [](#unstaking-7)Unstaking

Users can initiate a withdrawal of their TON tokens using the ‚ÄòUnstake‚Äô function in the BeMo application. Once unstaking is initiated, a cooldown period begins, lasting between 36 to 72 hours, depending on the phase and duration of the validation round.

After the cooldown period, stTON tokens are exchanged for TON tokens. The smart contract algorithm calculates the amount of TON tokens to be withdrawn based on the user‚Äôs unstaked stTON amount and the current stTON/TON exchange rate. Users can claim their requested TON tokens any time after the cooldown period expires.
