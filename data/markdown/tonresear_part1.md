# [Introducing Tonbridge: A Bridge from ETH to TON](/t/introducing-tonbridge-a-bridge-from-eth-to-ton/100)

[Application](/c/application/20) 

    

[Johnnie](https://tonresear.ch/u/Johnnie)  February 2, 2024, 12:40pm  1

The Tonbridge project represents a pivotal advancement in blockchain interoperability, specifically facilitating the bridging between Ethereum (ETH) and TON networks. This initiative is designed to streamline the transaction process across these two platforms, enhancing efficiency and expanding possibilities within the blockchain ecosystem.

## [](#core-functionalities-and-technologies-1)Core Functionalities and Technologies

At the heart of Tonbridge are two fundamental technologies:

*   **Merkle Proof Verification**: Leveraging FunC contracts, this feature enables the verification of transactional integrity on-chain, ensuring secure and tamper-proof cross-network transactions.
*   **BLS-Signature Verifications**: Also implemented through FunC contracts, this functionality authenticates Ethereum validators‚Äô signatures, a critical component for maintaining the reliability and trustworthiness of cross-chain operations.

These technologies are integral to the upcoming bridge project, which will include a relayer node to facilitate seamless transaction verification and validator authentication across the Ethereum and TON networks.

## [](#project-composition-2)Project Composition

### [](#key-components-3)Key Components

The project is structured into several key components, each serving a distinct role within the broader ecosystem:

*   **Contracts**: Contains the source code for all smart contracts associated with the project, along with their dependencies.
*   **Wrappers**: Provides wrapper classes that implement the `Contract` interface from ton-core, encompassing serialization/deserialization primitives and compilation functions.
*   **Tests**: A suite of tests designed to ensure the functionality and security of the contracts.
*   **Scripts**: Includes various scripts utilized by the project, predominantly focusing on deployment procedures.

### [](#usage-instructions-4)Usage Instructions

#### [](#building-and-testing-5)Building and Testing

For those interested in contributing to or deploying the Tonbridge project, the process is streamlined for ease of use:

*   **Building**: Execute `npx blueprint build` or `yarn blueprint build` to compile the contracts.
*   **Testing**: Run `npx blueprint test` or `yarn blueprint test` to verify the integrity and functionality of the contracts.
*   **Deployment**: Use `npx blueprint run` or `yarn blueprint run` for deploying contracts or running other project-related scripts.
*   **Adding New Contracts**: To expand the project‚Äôs capabilities, new contracts can be added with `npx blueprint create ContractName` or `yarn blueprint create ContractName`.

## [](#open-source-license-6)Open Source License

Tonbridge is committed to fostering an open and collaborative development environment. As such, the project is licensed under the MIT License, encouraging innovation and participation from the wider blockchain community.

In summary, Tonbridge is not just a bridge between two blockchain networks; it‚Äôs a step towards a more interconnected and efficient blockchain ecosystem. By providing robust verification mechanisms and streamlining cross-network transactions, Tonbridge aims to pave the way for a more versatile and scalable blockchain infrastructure.

Dear Squids,

As we reflect on the past month of game development, it‚Äôs with great pride that we acknowledge the numerous achievements we‚Äôve accomplished together.

Whether it‚Äôs the insightful user data analysis, fruitful collaborations with project partners, or the esteemed recognition from the Ton Foundation, it‚Äôs abundantly clear that SquidTG has cemented its status as a successful Inscription game.

Recognition by the Ton Foundation

However, our aspirations extend far beyond mere satisfaction. It is with great honor that we announce the establishment of the ‚ÄúSquidTG Metaverse.‚Äù

As many of you are aware, The Open Network presents an exceptional opportunity for growth. With SquidTG poised to construct an ecosystem (i.e., the SquidTG Metaverse) on this network, our vision encompasses not only gaming but also financial applications, social integration, ultimately culminating in the creation of a vibrant SquidTG Metaverse within The Open Network.

Allow us to elaborate further on the essence of the SquidTG Metaverse.

### [](#squidtg-2)SquidTG

[![image](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/5/5c7e4a03a425cbf2bdc2bf2940d24512eecd4e8f_2_690x388.jpeg)

](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5c7e4a03a425cbf2bdc2bf2940d24512eecd4e8f.jpeg "image")

On February 21, 2024, SquidTG made its debut as a Telegram-based Inscription game, marking the inception of what we now refer to as the SquidTG Metaverse.

As The Open Network continues to evolve, particularly in the realm of decentralized finance (DeFi), we anticipate it to follow a trajectory akin to that of Ethereum, achieving remarkable feats.

Hence, in anticipation of the forthcoming bull market, capital inflows into the TON ecosystem are inevitable. Notably, there are rumors that stablecoins such as USDT and USDC may be issued on TON, serving as pivotal assets for exchanges and pricing mechanisms, thereby heralding the onset of DeFi Summer on TON.

### [](#defi-summer-3)DeFi Summer

Following the successful onboarding of 50,000 Telegram users onto the Ton Space wallet, our next objective is to impart knowledge on optimizing wallet assets. This entails familiarizing users with concepts such as Swap, AMM, Liquidity Mining, and forthcoming DeFi products, including Lending.

[![image](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/1/17b78b4b2aa4ef04c08f62c8c2922e97557b5006_2_690x415.jpeg)

We are still early.

In essence, we aim to replicate the monumental DeFi Summer of 2020, as witnessed on Ethereum, within the confines of TON.

PS: It‚Äôs worth mentioning that if there are any products that have yet to appear on TON, you can look forward to the performance of the SquidTG team.

### [](#metaverse-4)Metaverse

Transitioning beyond gaming and financial realms, we aspire to establish an ecosystem that encapsulates myriad functionalities ‚Äî hence, the birth of the SquidTG Metaverse.

During this phase, SquidTG will introduce unique Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), imbued with social attributes, fostering a sense of community within the TON ecosystem. Consequently, participants from all walks of life will converge within the SquidTG game, collectively contributing towards the realization of TON‚Äôs Metaverse.

To enhance the accessibility of in-game assets, SquidTG game assets will soon be tokenized in the form of Jetton token $SQG, ensuring seamless participation for all users within the SquidTG Metaverse.

So, what lies ahead for SquidTG and the SquidTG Metaverse?

# [](#sqd-ido-and-token-airdrops-5)$SQD IDO and Token Airdrops

[![image](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/ccd654844acf0ff7138573941b2d3f7459b46076_2_690x388.jpeg)

To facilitate the development of the SquidTG Metaverse, we have decided to establish the foundation of the SquidTG Metaverse ‚Äî $SQD.

$SQD is the governance token of the SquidTG Metaverse. It will determine the direction of SquidTG‚Äôs games, the development path of the SquidTG Metaverse, and, most importantly, it will be the key to unlocking DeFi Summer on TON.

[![image](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/9/98c424f67bee16f05545a4c7a5b0695f5328c910_2_690x388.jpeg)

We have partnered with TonRaffles and Dedust for the ongoing $SQD IDO fundraising event. Join now: [https://tonraffles.app/jetton/fairlaunch/SQD](https://tonraffles.app/jetton/fairlaunch/SQD)

### [](#sqd-tokenomics-6)$SQD Tokenomics

[![image](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/3/3af57f89485abbee110250f2c3561d7b60bb1819_2_690x388.jpeg)

](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3af57f89485abbee110250f2c3561d7b60bb1819.jpeg "image")

From the tokenomics model of $SQD, we can see that 20% of the tokens will be available for IDO, of which 51% of the raised amount will be matched with 9.18% of the tokens locked in the liquidity pool of the exchange for 6.9 years. This means that the team does not intend to retrieve this fund and is committed to contributing it to the SquidTG community.

The main token allocation will prioritize airdrops for SquidTG game users (45.8%) and participation in liquidity mining (15%).

Finally, 5% will be reserved for ecological partners and the team, contributing to the joint development of the SquidTG Universe and boosting TON‚Äôs growth.

In summary, there are several ways to acquire $SQD:

1.  Purchase eggs and hatch squids directly in SquidTG to earn $SQD airdrops.
2.  Participate in the IDO on TonRaffles.
3.  Provide liquidity for $SQD/$TON on Dedust to earn $SQD and other token rewards daily.
4.  Reach out to us to join the SquidTG team or become a SquidTG ambassador and collaborate with us.

### [](#airdrop-7)Airdrop

There are various ways to obtain $SQD as mentioned above, and Airdrop is an immediate option available.

Here are the rules for the first wave of $SQD Airdrop, divided into Airdrop 1 & Airdrop 2:

#### [](#airdrop-1-15-for-og-squids-8)Airdrop 1 (15%): For OG Squids

*   Players who joined SquidTG before 2024/2/28 00:00 UTC and hold a quantity of squid > 0 will evenly split 15% of the Airdrop 1 pool.

#### [](#airdrop-2-15-for-young-squids-9)Airdrop 2 (15%): For Young Squids

*   The younger the Squid, the higher the Energy. Energy will gradually decrease as the Squid ages.
*   Calculation rule: The initial Energy of each newly hatched Squid is 1, and it will exponentially decrease over time, with a half-life of 14 days (29.3% decay in 7 days, 50% decay in 14 days).
*   The calculation of the half-life is by second, with decay occurring every second.

For example:

‚Üí If 10,000 Squids are hatched today, Squid Energy = 10,000

‚Üí After 7 days, if 20,000 Squids are hatched, Squid Energy = 10,000 \* (1‚Äì29.3%) + 20,000 = 27,070

‚Üí After another 7 days, Squid Energy = 27,070 \* (1‚Äì29.3%) = 19,138

*   This calculation will start from the first day of the game launch and continue until the end of the IDO, and then a snapshot will be taken. Airdrop 2 pool will be distributed based on the proportion of all players‚Äô Squid Energy.
*   The airdrop will occur within a week after the end of IDO.

Telegram bot for checking the airdrop energy: [Telegram: Contact @squid\_airdrop\_bot](https://t.me/squid_airdrop_bot)

Last but not least, the SquidTG team invites you to join us in building the SquidTG Metaverse. Let‚Äôs seize the growth dividend in the early days of the TON ecosystem together.

SquidTG Metaverse, LFG!

Token name: durev

Durev is a memecoin on the TON network!

[Website](https://poveldurev.net/)

[Project‚Äôs Twitter](https://x.com/poveldurev)

[Project‚Äôs Telegram](https://t.me/poveldurev)

Povel Durev is the greatest entrepreneur of all time in the whole world, and maybe not only in this world. He is the director of Telegrams, a company that transmits messages by air using electricity. He is the president of TON, an Internet money company. His job is to make billions of TONS. Our job is to make billions of tons of memes.

He emerged victorious from the battles with the KGB, the SEC and the whole world alone. Now it‚Äôs our time to fight for him!

$durev is created for strong-minded and good people. By buying $durev, you contribute to the improvement of the world through the appearance of tons of memes!

Durev is live on DeDust. Liquidity lock and loaded. What‚Äôs next?

1.  We‚Äôve adding boosts for liquidity providers now. Currently, the APY is very juicy ‚Äì earn more $durev and bonus tokens from partners, helping the project. It‚Äôs a win-win.
    
2.  In about a week, another listing, we‚Äôre adding liquidity on StonFi, so $durev can be bought directly inside TonKeeper. We‚Äôre also expecting a whitelist for our token from Tonkeeper soon.
    
3.  We‚Äôre preparing a Durev NFT collection. For $durev holders, there will be huge bonuses. Already talking with new memecoins for drops to NFT holders. Bullish!
    
4.  We continue to do crazy marketing with KOLs, planning AMAs with top channels, signing even more partnerships, and beginning to select a CEX for listing.

# [Revolutionizing Blockchain Voting: An Introduction to 0 Gas Vote on TON Blockchain](/t/revolutionizing-blockchain-voting-an-introduction-to-0-gas-vote-on-ton-blockchain/102)

[Application](/c/application/20) 

    

[satoshi](https://tonresear.ch/u/satoshi)  February 2, 2024, 12:47pm  1

### [](#abstract-1)Abstract

This paper presents an innovative approach to blockchain voting through the development of a smart-contract tool designed for the TON (Telegram Open Network) blockchain. Developed by XPTeam for the TON contest running from June 2nd to June 25th, 2023, the 0 Gas Vote project leverages the new **ECRECOVER** opcode in TON‚Äôs TVM (TON Virtual Machine) to enable whitelisted users to cast votes without incurring gas fees, traditionally a barrier to participation in decentralized voting mechanisms.

### [](#introduction-2)Introduction

Blockchain technology offers a transparent, secure, and immutable way to conduct elections and polls, promising to revolutionize the traditional voting systems plagued by inefficiencies and vulnerabilities. However, the associated gas fees for transactions on blockchain networks often deter widespread adoption. Addressing this challenge, the 0 Gas Vote project introduces a method allowing users to participate in voting activities on the TON blockchain without bearing the cost of gas fees, thus enhancing accessibility and participation.

### [](#methodology-3)Methodology

The core of the 0 Gas Vote system is a smart contract deployed on the TON blockchain, which utilizes the **ECRECOVER** opcode to validate voters‚Äô signatures without spending gas. The process begins with the setup of the voting parameters within the smart contract, including the ballot ID, voting model, and a whitelist of eligible voters‚Äô public keys.

Voters generate a pair of keys and provide the public key to the administrator, who then whitelists the voters by recording their public key hashes on the smart contract. To cast a vote, a voter signs a predetermined message (either for or against the proposal) with their private key. The signature, along with the voter‚Äôs choice, is sent to the administrator, who then submits it to the smart contract.

The smart contract, leveraging the **ECRECOVER** opcode, verifies the signature against the voter‚Äôs public key hash stored on the blockchain. Upon successful verification, the vote is recorded, and the tallies for or against the proposal are updated accordingly.

### [](#results-and-discussion-4)Results and Discussion

The implementation of the 0 Gas Vote system was tested during the specified contest period, with the deployment and operation of the smart contract documented in detail. While the innovative use of **ECRECOVER** promises a gasless voting experience, the project encountered a significant obstacle with the opcode returning only a status 0 for any hash, v, r, s combination, indicating a potential flaw in the TON TVM‚Äôs handling of the opcode.

Despite this setback, the project showcases a pivotal step towards enabling gas-free transactions on the TON blockchain, potentially transforming how voting and governance can be conducted in decentralized systems. The resolution of the **ECRECOVER** opcode issue remains a critical next step for the project.

### [](#conclusion-5)Conclusion

The 0 Gas Vote project represents a significant advancement in blockchain voting technologies, addressing the critical barrier of gas fees. By allowing voters to participate without incurring transaction costs, the project opens new avenues for democratic participation in blockchain governance. Further research and development are required to overcome the technical challenges encountered, underscoring the importance of continuous innovation in the blockchain sector.

**An In-depth Analysis and Potential Questions on the Zero-Gas Voting Smart Contract on TON**

**Introduction:**  
The ‚Äú0 gas vote-ton‚Äù project, submitted by XPTeam for the TON contest from June 2nd to June 25th, 2023, represents a significant innovation in the realm of blockchain voting systems. This smart-contract voting tool enables whitelisted users to vote without incurring gas fees, leveraging the new ECRECOVER opcode in the TON Virtual Machine (TVM). This analysis delves into the project‚Äôs design, functionality, and potential areas for further inquiry, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of its implications for decentralized voting mechanisms.

**Technical Overview:**  
The project outlines a step-by-step process for deploying and interacting with the voting smart contract on the TON blockchain. Key aspects include the installation of npm requirements, configuration of smart contract parameters (e.g., ballot\_id, vote\_count\_model\_selector, admin address), and the deployment process. Voters participate by generating key pairs, signing their votes, and having the admin submit these to the blockchain, with the smart contract verifying signatures using the ECRECOVER opcode.

**Professional Insight:**  
The use of the ECRECOVER opcode is a standout feature, aiming to authenticate voter signatures without necessitating gas fees for each vote. This approach could revolutionize how voting is conducted on blockchain platforms by making it more accessible and cost-effective. Furthermore, the detailed setup process, from contract deployment to vote submission, demonstrates a thorough consideration of user interaction and security.

**Areas for Further Inquiry:**

1.  **ECRECOVER Opcode Reliability:** The project notes an issue where the ECRECOVER opcode returns a status of 0 for any input, suggesting a potential bug in the implementation. A critical question arises on how this affects the contract‚Äôs security and integrity, and what steps are being taken to address this anomaly.
2.  **Scalability and Performance:** Given the project‚Äôs reliance on admin intervention for vote submission, questions about scalability and efficiency in larger elections emerge. How does the system perform under significant load, and what mechanisms are in place to ensure timely processing of votes?
3.  **Security Measures:** The security implications of having an admin responsible for submitting votes need closer examination. What safeguards are implemented to prevent misuse or manipulation of votes by the admin or other attackers?
4.  **Voter Anonymity and Privacy:** While the project outlines a method for voting without gas fees, it‚Äôs essential to consider the privacy implications for voters. How does the system ensure voter anonymity, and what measures are in place to protect voter choices from being linked to their blockchain addresses?
5.  **Adaptability to Other Use Cases:** The project hints at potential extensions, such as creating a multi-signature wallet for TON. Exploring other applications of this voting mechanism could unveil new opportunities and challenges. What considerations should be made when adapting this system to different contexts or use cases?

**Conclusion:**  
The ‚Äú0 gas vote-ton‚Äù project offers an intriguing approach to blockchain-based voting, potentially lowering barriers to participation through the innovative use of the ECRECOVER opcode. However, the noted issue with opcode performance raises important questions about its current reliability and the broader implications for secure, decentralized voting systems. As the project evolves, addressing these questions and exploring the system‚Äôs scalability, security, and adaptability will be crucial in realizing its full potential. Engaging with these inquiries can stimulate further development and refinement, contributing to the advancement of blockchain technology in democratic processes.

Narrative:

Once upon a time in the vast and mystical land of Ton, a token was born. A token like no other, a token that would soon become a legend in the Ton network. This token was TonZilla, the first Dragon of the network.

In the early days, when there was barely any volume in the Ton network, TonZilla stood strong. With a market cap of only $500, we pushed forward, never giving up on our dream of making TonZilla a reference in the Ton network.

What started as a meme soon grew into something more. Thanks to the community‚Äôs support, we created utilities like a trending channel, our very own BuyBot that we can offer to other projects, and an incredible Price bot that provides all the information you need with just a simple command.

From a humble beginning of $400 market cap, TonZilla has soared to an impressive $125k market cap. And this is just the beginning. Our community is strong and stable, holding up the floor and driving TonZilla to new heights.

Join us in the revolution of the first Dragon in the Ton network! ![:dragon:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/dragon.png?v=12 ":dragon:")![:rocket:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/rocket.png?v=12 ":rocket:") #TonZilla #TonNetwork #DragonToken

At its core, the NFT layer encapsulates the essence of the TDBt framework, enabling the representation of diverse entities as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This layer leverages the versatility of NFTs to encapsulate data and metadata for various entities, ranging from digital assets in gaming to real-world identities and beyond. The adaptability of this layer is further enhanced through the implementation of customizable NFT standards, allowing developers to tailor the representation and management of entities according to specific application needs.

### [](#the-nft-collections-layer-3)The NFT Collections Layer

Building upon the NFT layer, the NFT Collections layer introduces a structured approach to group and manage NFTs. This layer adopts and extends the TON NFT Editable Collection standard, integrating specialized functions and data structures for efficient management and interaction with grouped NFTs. The design of this layer facilitates the dynamic and flexible categorization of NFTs, enabling applications to efficiently organize and manipulate collections of NFTs for various functional requirements.

### [](#tdbs-the-master-contract-4)TDBs: The Master Contract

The TDBs smart contract forms the pinnacle of the TDBt architecture, acting as the central command and control center for the entire network. It is responsible for the governance of NFT Collections and Jetton-masters, streamlining the process of deployment, management, and interaction with these entities. TDBs exemplify a significant innovation in smart contract design, offering a comprehensive suite of functionalities to manage the intricate dynamics of decentralized backends, including ownership transfer, code editing, and funds withdrawal, among others.

## [](#functional-capabilities-5)Functional Capabilities

TDBt introduces a suite of features and capabilities designed to empower developers with the tools needed to build sophisticated dApps. Key functionalities include:

*   **Smart Contract Management**: TDBt facilitates the deployment, updating, and deletion of smart contracts within the network, enabling the dynamic evolution of dApps.
*   **Data Handling**: The framework provides mechanisms for storing, updating, and retrieving data across the network, leveraging the inherent capabilities of NFTs and smart contracts for data manipulation.
*   **Application Interaction**: TDBt enables the development of serverless frontends, allowing for direct interaction with the blockchain backend, thereby enhancing user experience and reducing reliance on traditional server-based architectures.

## [](#implementing-decentralized-applications-6)Implementing Decentralized Applications

TDBt‚Äôs comprehensive design and functionality pave the way for the creation of a wide array of decentralized applications. For instance, in the context of a freelance exchange platform, TDBt can facilitate the representation of freelancers, orders, and service transactions as NFTs, enabling a transparent, immutable, and decentralized ecosystem for freelance work. This not only enhances security and trust among participants but also opens up new avenues for the application of blockchain technology beyond conventional financial uses.

## [](#conclusion-7)Conclusion

The Tokenized Decentralized Backend template on TON represents a significant leap forward in the development of decentralized applications. By harnessing the power of NFTs, smart contracts, and the TON blockchain, TDBt offers a versatile, scalable, and secure framework for the next generation of dApps. Its innovative approach to decentralized backend design has the potential to catalyze the mass adoption of blockchain technology across various sectors, heralding a new era of decentralized digital solutions.

TON NFT dApp - decentralized backend solution on TON

 

[ASURADA](https://tonresear.ch/u/ASURADA) February 3, 2024, 10:19am  3

The article presents a comprehensive overview of the Tokenized Decentralized Backend template (TDBt), an innovative framework designed for the development of scalable, multi-user, decentralized applications (dApps) on the TON blockchain. This framework leverages the capabilities of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), NFT Collections, and a novel type of smart contract referred to as Token Decentralized Backend smart contracts (TDBs). The goal is to facilitate the creation of complex, decentralized applications that are comparable to Web 2.0 services but with the added benefits of decentralization.

### [](#professional-insights-1)Professional Insights:

1.  **Decentralization and Scalability**: The TDBt framework introduces a structured approach to building dApps that emphasizes decentralization and scalability. By tokenizing backend elements and representing them as NFTs or collections of NFTs, TDBt enables a flexible and efficient means to manage data and interactions within a decentralized network. This approach not only enhances scalability but also introduces a novel paradigm for data management and interaction within blockchain applications.
    
2.  **Editable NFTs and Jettons for Data Management**: The concept of using editable NFTs and Jettons as units for data storage, retrieval, and management is both innovative and practical. This extends the utility of NFTs beyond mere collectibles or digital art to functional components of decentralized applications. Such a strategy allows for dynamic data management and could significantly impact how entities are represented and interacted with on the blockchain.
    
3.  **Smart Contract Hierarchy and Interactions**: The hierarchical structure of smart contracts, from the NFT layer through the NFT Collections layer to the top-layer TDBs, facilitates a clear separation of concerns. This structure ensures that each layer focuses on its specific set of responsibilities, enhancing the system‚Äôs overall efficiency and manageability. The asynchronous interaction between these layers further contributes to the scalability and flexibility of the system.
    
4.  **Upgradability and Maintenance**: The ability to edit and upgrade smart contracts, including the main TDBs, collections, and individual NFTs, addresses one of the critical challenges in blockchain development: the difficulty of updating smart contracts once deployed. This feature is crucial for maintaining and evolving dApps over time, ensuring they can adapt to new requirements or address any issues that arise.
    
5.  **Serverless Frontend Integration**: The concept of integrating a tokenized decentralized backend with a serverless frontend is particularly compelling. It suggests a complete, end-to-end decentralized application model that can operate independently of traditional web hosting services, enhancing censorship resistance and reducing reliance on centralized infrastructure.
    

### [](#professional-questions-2)Professional Questions:

### [](#what-is-pocketfi-1)What is PocketFi?

**[PocketFi](https://t.me/pocketfi_bot/Mining?startapp=244074224)** is the ultimate solution for seamless **cross-chain token transfers, snipes, copytrading**, and much more! It is designed to revolutionize the way you navigate the world of decentralized finance in Telegram as a Mini-App. A new approach that PocketFi brings together with an **extensive range of decentralized exchanges (DEXes)**, **innovative bridges**, and all encapsulated within a single, user-friendly bot using new tools from the Telegram team. This synergy of technologies allows you to have **full control**, **initiate token swaps**, **earn on sniping opportunities**, and **manage multiple wallets**.

PocketFi allows you to effortlessly transfer token A on the C chain to token B on the D chain, all with just a few clicks, where the bot serves as the nexus to any-to-any interactions.

### [](#what-problem-do-we-solve-with-this-bot-2)What problem do we solve with this bot?

A telegram-based bot is a new approach for any trader because of its tooling. Here is a common problem in the current web3 world:

*   **Complexity of Cross-Chain Transactions:** Cross-chain swaps often involve juggling between various decentralized exchanges (DEXes) and bridges, leading to confusion and inefficiency.
    
*   **Optimal Route Selection:** Choosing the best route for your cross-chain swap can be challenging, with factors like gas fees, protocol fees, and security to consider.
    
*   **Timely and Accurate Information:** In the fast-paced world of crypto, having outdated or inaccurate route information can be detrimental.
    
*   **Overall Efficiency:** Navigating various platforms, keeping track of multiple transactions, and managing different protocols can be time-consuming and overwhelming.
    

**PocketFi** solves them all by:

*   Simplifying this process by aggregating more DEXes, bridges, and chains than any other aggregator, giving you a one-stop solution for your cross-chain needs.
    
*   PocketFi lets you set your desired slippage percentage, ensuring transparency and helping you make informed decisions.
    
*   PocketFi takes the guesswork out by intelligently sorting and presenting routes that cater to your preferences and needs.
    
*   PocketFI provides real-time data, ensuring you have the most up-to-date information for your swaps or bridges or maybe your staking positions.
    

Experience the power of PocketFi and enjoy a smoother, more effective cross-chain swapping experience. We‚Äôre here to simplify the complex world of crypto transactions and empower you to trade with confidence!

### [](#how-does-the-aggregation-work-3)How does the aggregation work?

Seamless Routes via PocketFi router goes beyond the basics. It‚Äôs your go-to platform for transferring Token A on Chain C to Token B on Chain D. Our robust aggregator pulls in more DEXes, bridges, and chains than any other project in Telegram and in Web3, ensuring you find the optimal routes with maximum liquidity to reach the minimal losses due to slippage and minimal fees from providers.

With PocketFi, you can choose from three straightforward ways to perform any-to-any cross-chain transactions:

1.  **Multi-Transaction:** Swap and bridge in the first transaction, and then swap again on the target chain. It‚Äôs safe but a tad inconvenient, and rate fluctuations could cause hiccups. Most likely, such a router user will not meet but we ensure that if he meets such a Route, he will proceed with it in a minute.
    
2.  **Bridge-Direct:** The best choice for the user! Executes a single transaction through integrated DEXes on the decentralized bridge. Fast, secure, and slippage-tolerant.
    
3.  **Semi-Centralized:** Opt for a one-shot transaction via semi-centralized bridges like Hyphen. A balanced option with integrated DEXes and partial centralization for convenience.

*   **Maximize Returns:** See tokens received in likely slippage and the most probable outcomes.

#### [](#defi-yields-in-beta-7)DeFi Yields (in beta)

PocketFi supports all possible DeFi yield farming opportunities. Users can provide liquidity to liquidity pools on platforms like Uniswap, and PancakeSwap. Lend money to the Stargate or maybe even enter a Leveraged position on Gearbox. We can help users manage their deposited assets, directly interact with DeFi smart contracts, and handle compounding or yield withdrawals.

#### [](#wallet-integration-and-security-8)Wallet Integration and Security

Secure authentication or integration with trusted wallet providers is essential. This is why from this seed phrase, PocketFI generates an HD wallet (Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet) key, using the userID within our bot and the selected wallet. This enables PocketFI to dynamically generate multiple wallets for each user on the fly. Importantly, each user can only access their own subset of keys. This way, PocketFI doesn‚Äôt store each user‚Äôs private key in the database. In fact, PocketFI stores minimal information about the user because even if the entire database is compromised, only non-critical, anonymized data will be present (like the TG handle). The utmost care must be taken to protect user private keys or seed phrases, implementing robust security practices.

#### [](#user-notifications-and-alerts-9)User Notifications and Alerts

Real-time notifications keep users informed about transaction progress, swaps, yields, and other activities. These notifications enable users to stay updated and make well-timed decisions based on those alert.

Recently TON Validators have approved the TON Core Dev team‚Äôs proposal for a further **2.5x reduction in transaction fees**. That allowed to reduce gas fee for swaps to dynamic **0.08 - 0.3 TON**.

Also, **swaps interface was reworked** so now it shows the gas that is most likely shall provide a successful transaction and unused gas will be refunded.

This should increase the stability and convenience of the PocketFi bot interactions.

Have a nice weekends, more things coming next week!

# [Decentralizing Electoral Integrity: The VotON Platform](/t/decentralizing-electoral-integrity-the-voton-platform/104)

[Application](/c/application/20) 

    

[satoshi](https://tonresear.ch/u/satoshi)   February 2, 2024, 12:57pm  1

In the evolving landscape of digital democracy, the VotON project emerges as a pioneering solution, integrating the robustness of blockchain technology with the accessibility of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) wallets. This project, developed using the Next.js framework, signifies a significant leap towards creating a decentralized voting platform, leveraging the TON blockchain‚Äôs capabilities to facilitate secure and exclusive electoral processes.

## [](#project-overview-1)Project Overview

The core of VotON is built on a Next.js application, which forms the user interface, offering an intuitive and accessible platform for users to engage with the voting process. The backbone of VotON‚Äôs functionality lies in its contract, housed within the `/contract` folder, crafted using the blueprint framework. This contract is pivotal for the operational integrity of the platform.

## [](#technical-challenges-and-current-status-2)Technical Challenges and Current Status

VotON‚Äôs progression has faced challenges, notably with the setback in the `HASHEXT_KECCAK256` opcode‚Äôs functionality. This opcode is crucial for hashing messages in the Ethereum Signed Message format, a standard procedure for verifying transactions and interactions on the blockchain. The current non-operational state of this opcode has temporarily hindered the project‚Äôs completion and full deployment.

## [](#innovations-in-blockchain-voting-3)Innovations in Blockchain Voting

VotON introduces innovative use of opcodes such as `ECRECOVER`, which is instrumental in extracting Ethereum addresses from signatures. This technical capability underpins the platform‚Äôs exclusive voting mechanism, where only whitelisted EVM wallets can participate. This approach ensures that voting is restricted to verified individuals or entities, enhancing the security and integrity of the electoral process.

## [](#use-case-whitelisted-evm-wallet-voting-4)Use Case: Whitelisted EVM Wallet Voting

A standout feature of VotON is its ability to facilitate voting exclusively through whitelisted EVM wallets. This mechanism leverages the interoperability of the TON network with EVM-compatible wallets, ensuring that only authorized participants can engage in voting. This specificity makes VotON an ideal platform for scenarios requiring stringent control over voter eligibility, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness and reliability of the voting outcomes.

## [](#getting-involved-5)Getting Involved

For developers and enthusiasts looking to contribute or explore VotON, the process is straightforward. The project can be cloned from its GitHub repository, with dependencies easily installed via npm. Starting the development server then allows for local exploration and development, providing a hands-on experience with the platform‚Äôs capabilities.

## [](#conclusion-6)Conclusion

VotON stands at the intersection of blockchain technology and democratic processes, offering a glimpse into the future of secure, decentralized voting. Despite technical hurdles, the project‚Äôs foundation‚Äîbolstered by its innovative use of blockchain opcodes and a commitment to electoral integrity‚Äîpromises a revolutionary approach to ensuring transparent and accessible voting in the digital age. As VotON continues to evolve, it remains a beacon for the potential of blockchain technology to enhance and protect democratic participation.

## [](#license-7)License

The VotON project is released under the MIT license, reflecting its open-source nature and the developers‚Äô commitment to accessibility and community contribution.

The article introduces VotON, a decentralized voting platform designed to operate within the TON (The Open Network) ecosystem, leveraging Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) wallets for participation. This review will delve into both the technical and conceptual aspects of the platform, raising professional insights and questions pertinent to its development, functionality, and potential impact.

### [](#professional-insights-1)Professional Insights

1.  **Ethereum Compatibility**: The use of `HASHEXT_KECCAK256` and `ECRECOVER` opcodes to integrate Ethereum‚Äôs signing and address recovery mechanisms is innovative. This approach not only facilitates seamless interaction with Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem but also extends the utility of TON by enabling EVM-compatible transactions. It‚Äôs a strategic move to attract a broader user base familiar with Ethereum‚Äôs operations.
    
2.  **Security Concerns**: Implementing a whitelist for EVM wallets introduces a layer of security and exclusivity to the voting process. However, the method‚Äôs security largely depends on how the whitelist is managed and the integrity of the underlying smart contract. The challenge lies in ensuring that the whitelist cannot be tampered with or bypassed, which requires rigorous smart contract auditing.
    
3.  **Scalability and Performance**: Next.js as the frontend framework suggests an emphasis on performance and user experience, given its server-side rendering capabilities. However, the scalability of VotON will significantly depend on the TON blockchain‚Äôs throughput and the efficiency of the smart contract code, especially when handling large volumes of votes.
    
4.  **Interoperability**: By integrating features that accommodate EVM wallets, VotON is positioned as a cross-chain platform. This interoperability is crucial for fostering collaboration and asset transfer across different blockchain networks, potentially increasing the platform‚Äôs usability and adoption.
    

### [](#professional-questions-2)Professional Questions

1.  **How does VotON address the non-functional state of the `HASHEXT_KECCAK256` opcode?** This technical setback could significantly impact the project‚Äôs timeline and functionality. Are there any workarounds or alternative solutions being considered?
    
2.  **What measures are in place to ensure the security and integrity of the whitelisting process?** Given the potential for manipulation or security breaches, understanding the safeguards against such risks is crucial.
    
3.  **How does VotON plan to scale with an increasing number of participants and votes?** Details on the blockchain‚Äôs capacity, transaction speed, and how the platform intends to manage potential bottlenecks would be insightful.
    
4.  **Is there a governance model for VotON itself?** For a decentralized voting platform, having a transparent and fair governance model is essential to ensure that the platform remains aligned with its users‚Äô interests and can adapt to future challenges.
    
5.  **What are the implications of the MIT license in the context of VotON‚Äôs deployment and use?** While the MIT license promotes openness and collaboration, it also allows for commercial use. How does VotON intend to balance openness with the need to maintain a secure and reliable voting platform?
    

These insights and questions aim to highlight the innovative aspects of VotON while also identifying areas where further clarification or development may be necessary to ensure the platform‚Äôs success and reliability in the decentralized voting space.

# [Navigating the Evolution of Wallet Contracts in TON Blockchain](/t/navigating-the-evolution-of-wallet-contracts-in-ton-blockchain/106)

[Application](/c/application/wallet/22)  [Wallet](/c/application/wallet/22) 

    

[Johnnie](https://tonresear.ch/u/Johnnie)  February 2, 2024, 1:03pm  1

In the rapidly evolving landscape of blockchain technology, the TON (Telegram Open Network) Blockchain stands out for its unique approach to wallet infrastructure. Unlike other blockchains like Ethereum or Solana, which typically have a uniform wallet structure, TON introduces a diverse ecosystem of wallet contracts, each version tailored to specific functionalities and use cases. This article delves into the various versions and modifications of TON wallet contracts, offering a comprehensive comparison to understand their differences and applications.

## [](#understanding-wallet-contract-variations-1)Understanding Wallet Contract Variations

At the heart of TON‚Äôs innovative wallet system is the concept that each wallet is essentially a smart contract. This paradigm allows for a high degree of customization and functionality, paving the way for multiple wallet versions, each with its set of features. Below, we compare the primary wallet versions developed on the TON Blockchain to highlight their key differences and use cases.

### [](#basic-wallets-comparison-2)Basic Wallets Comparison

### [](#special-wallets-comparison-3)Special Wallets Comparison

Type

Functionality

Use Case

High-load wallet

Up to 254 transactions per smart contract call, different approach to prevent replay attacks

Crypto exchanges, high-volume transactions

Lockup wallet

Lock coins until a specified time, with customizable unlock periods

Vesting schedules, time-locked funds

Restricted wallet

Transfers allowed to only one pre-defined destination address, excluding validation contracts

Controlled spending, validator operation with restricted funds

## [](#highlighted-features-and-considerations-4)Highlighted Features and Considerations

*   **Seqno Retrieval**: The ability to retrieve the sequence number (seqno) and public key from the contract is crucial for managing transactions and ensuring the security of operations. V1 lacks this feature, which is subsequently added in revisions and newer versions.
*   **`valid_until` Parameter**: Introduced in Wallet V2, this parameter allows users to set a time limit on transactions, adding an extra layer of control and security.
*   **`subwallet_id`**: Available from Wallet V3 onwards, this feature enables the creation of multiple wallets under the same public key, simplifying wallet management for users.
*   **Plugins**: A distinctive feature of Wallet V4, plugins allow for the integration of complex logic with the wallet‚Äôs operations, opening up possibilities for automated transactions and enhanced interaction with DApps.

## [](#conclusion-5)Conclusion

The TON Blockchain‚Äôs approach to wallet contracts represents a significant advancement in the flexibility and functionality available to users. From the basic Wallet V1 to the feature-rich Wallet V4, each version caters to different needs, ranging from simple transactions to advanced use cases requiring automated logic. Moreover, special wallets like high-load, lockup, and restricted wallets offer tailored solutions for specific scenarios, further demonstrating the versatility of TON‚Äôs wallet contract ecosystem. Understanding these variations enables users and developers to select the most appropriate wallet version for their requirements, ensuring optimal performance and security on the TON Blockchain.

## [](#see-also-6)See Also

Why Integrating Stablecoins Like USDC & USDT Will Boost The TON Ecosystem

I am excited to see the fast rise of $TON! Integrating stablecoins like USDC and USDT could be a game-changer for the ecosystem. Here‚Äôs why:

Reduced Volatility: Crypto prices can be wild. Stablecoins, pegged to currencies like USD, offer a safe haven. Users can park funds in USDC/USDT during dips and buy back in confidently. This encourages participation and reduces fear of market swings.

Increased Liquidity: Stablecoins attract new users who might be hesitant about crypto volatility. More users mean more trading activity, tighter spreads (difference between buy & sell prices), and a smoother overall experience for everyone.

Enhanced DeFi Applications: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is huge on TON. Stablecoins are the fuel for DeFi protocols like lending, borrowing, and yield farming. Integration unlocks a whole new world of financial tools for users.

Improved Fiat On-Ramp & Off-Ramp: Buying TON with fiat (USD, EUR) can be cumbersome. Stablecoins bridge the gap. Users can easily convert between fiat and USDC/USDT on exchanges, then swap them for TON within the TON ecosystem. This simplifies entry and exit for everyone.

Wider Adoption & Merchant Integration: Imagine buying coffee with TON! Stablecoins make TON more usable for everyday transactions. Merchants can accept TON knowing they receive a stable value, attracting more users to the TON network.

I also understand that stable coin integration isn‚Äôt without its complexities (regulation, transparency). However, the potential benefits for the TON ecosystem are undeniable. This move could solidify TON as a major player in the crypto space.

What do you think, TON fam? Would stablecoin integration be a win?

$TOL is a meme community token inspired by The Open League and the TON ecosystem. TOL is not an official token of The Open League. TOL is created for fun and entertainment purposes, and it encourages users and contributors to learn about the TON ecosystem, explore its projects, and potentially earn rewards. TOL does not represent any official affiliation with The Open League.

A fan mechanics for token mining - you connect your wallet, and upload a meme that relates to Open League, after checking for adequacy it goes into the chat - the number of reactions = the ability to claim that many tokens. Gamification!

> Airdrop snapshot: April 10, 09.30 am CET  
> Airdrop execution: April 11

### [](#eligibility-criteria-2)Eligibility criteria

The snapshot captures all wallets that performed swaps on Dedust and/or [Ston.fi](http://Ston.fi) between March 4 (12pm CET) and April 10 (09.30 CET) using pairs with TON or stable coins and whitelisted tokens. Sybil wallet addresses were disqualified.

Whitelisted tokens included the memecoins that were part of the [Memecoin leaderboard of The Open League](https://ton.org/en/open-league?filterBy=forProjects) at the time of the snapshot and those that ranked in the top 10 meme coins by trading volume since March 4. The whitelist hence consists of the following tokens:

*   FISH
    
*   ANON
    
*   REDO
    
*   MRDN
    
*   TONY
    
*   ARBUZ
    
*   durev
    
*   TPET
    
*   @BTC25
    
*   WIF
    
*   COFE
    
*   CATS
    
*   BOLT
    

\*This is not endorsement or investment advice. The tokens were selected based on the metrics provided by [re:doubt.](https://beta.redoubt.online/tracker)

The four eligibility criteria, which were set using the rough median value as the minimum threshold, are as follows:

*   Number of swaps > 10
*   Total trading volume ‚â• $2700
*   Number of whitelisted tokens that were traded by the wallet > 2
*   Current amount of whitelisted tokens on the balance ‚â• $650

With the aim of determining the size of the airdrop for each beneficiary, a points system was created. Based on the volume, the number of swaps, the number of whitelisted tokens that were traded and the current amount of whitelisted tokens on the balance, each wallet was assigned points. The sum of the points was the final score. Final scores above the median were then grouped into ranges and the size of rewards for each range of scores was determined.

# [\[TEP-1\] Enhancing TON Through Structured Innovation: The TEP Lifecycle Framework](/t/tep-1-enhancing-ton-through-structured-innovation-the-tep-lifecycle-framework/109)

[TON Blockchain](/c/ton-blockchain/17) 

[tep](https://tonresear.ch/tag/tep)

    

[doge](https://tonresear.ch/u/doge)  February 2, 2024, 1:11pm  1

In the dynamic ecosystem of the TON (The Open Network) blockchain, the introduction of the TON Enhancement Proposal (TEP) system marks a pivotal advancement in standardizing and streamlining the process of proposing, discussing, and implementing innovations within the network. This paper delves into the TEP lifecycle, providing a structured framework that encourages meticulous analysis, rigorous discussion, and efficient adoption of proposals aimed at enhancing various aspects of the TON blockchain.

## [](#introduction-to-tep-1)Introduction to TEP

The TEP, or TON Enhancement Proposal, serves as a formal design document that outlines proposed enhancements to the TON blockchain. These proposals can encompass a wide range of topics, from network protocols like ADNL to smart contract interfaces for NFTs. The need for a more structured proposal process arose from the limitations of the informal TIP system, which struggled to manage the complexities of proposing, discussing, and accepting new standards effectively.

## [](#tep-lifecycle-and-roles-2)TEP Lifecycle and Roles

The lifecycle of a TEP involves several key stages and roles, ensuring that each proposal is thoroughly vetted and discussed before being accepted or rejected. The primary roles within the TEP process include the Author, Editor, and Reviewer, each with distinct responsibilities in guiding a TEP from conception to conclusion.

### [](#tep-creation-and-review-process-3)TEP Creation and Review Process

The process begins with the proposal‚Äôs creation, where the Author drafts the TEP using a specified template and submits it as a pull request on the TEP GitHub repository. This draft includes a comprehensive header, a detailed body with sections such as Summary, Motivation, Specification, and Drawbacks, and adheres to formal requirements outlined in RFC 2119.

Upon submission, the TEP enters the Review stage, where assigned Reviewers and the community at large engage in discussions, critiques, and voting on the proposal. This phase is crucial for refining the TEP and ensuring it aligns with the community‚Äôs needs and technical standards.

### [](#lifecycle-stages-4)Lifecycle Stages

Stage

Description

Draft

The initial phase where the TEP is drafted and submitted for review.

Review

A period of community discussion, critique, and voting on the proposal.

Active

The TEP has been accepted and is considered an active standard within the TON ecosystem.

Rejected

The TEP has been rejected and is not merged into the repository. It may be revisited or revised for future submission.

Replaced

The TEP has been superseded by a newer proposal, indicating the evolution and continuous improvement of the TON blockchain standards.

## [](#comparative-analysis-5)Comparative Analysis

The development of the TEP system was influenced by existing enhancement proposal frameworks from other blockchain and technology communities, such as Ethereum‚Äôs EIPs and Rust‚Äôs RFCs. The table below highlights the distinctions and inspirations drawn from these precedents:

Aspect

TEP Approach

Inspiration and Rationale

Proposal Structure

Detailed sections including Summary, Motivation, and Specification

Borrowed from Rust RFCs, emphasizing comprehensive analysis and discussion before community engagement.

Review Process

Review and Final Comment Period (FCP) conducted entirely within pull requests

Simplifies the review process by allowing for iterative improvements and community consensus building.

Header Format

Simplified header with links to pull requests and author details

Adapted from Rust RFCs for improved usability and accessibility, departing from the RFC 822 header used in other proposal systems.

## [](#challenges-and-future-directions-6)Challenges and Future Directions

While the TEP system represents a significant step forward in formalizing the proposal process within the TON ecosystem, it faces challenges in reviewer engagement and management of the review process. Future enhancements may include clarifying the criteria and process for selecting reviewers, as well as exploring mechanisms to incentivize and ensure timely reviews.

## [](#conclusion-7)Conclusion

The TEP lifecycle framework introduces a structured and formalized process for proposing and reviewing enhancements to the TON blockchain. By drawing inspiration from established proposal systems and adapting to the unique needs of the TON community, the TEP system aims to foster a culture of innovation, collaboration, and continuous improvement. As the TON ecosystem evolves, the TEP process will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping its future development and ensuring its adaptability to the ever-changing landscape of blockchain technology.

# Summary

This document introduces TEP -- TON Enhancement Proposal. TEP is a design document which describes some part of TON, for example ADNL (network protocol between nodes) or NFT (interface which is common to smart contracts of a single type).

# Motivation

Current TIP system is too informal to manage the process of writing, discussing and accepting new standards efficiently. TON needs a new proposal process, which will encourage authors to do a deep dive into the topic and write down all points to have a constructive discussion with the community.

The introduction of TEP (TON Enhancement Proposal) as outlined in this document aims to formalize the process for proposing, discussing, and implementing new standards and enhancements within the TON blockchain ecosystem. The document, spearheaded by Vladimir Lebedev and supported by contributions from noted community members, lays down a structured framework to streamline innovations and modifications to TON.

### [](#professional-insight-1)Professional Insight:

The TEP lifecycle introduces a rigorous yet flexible framework that is essential for the structured evolution of a blockchain ecosystem as dynamic and expansive as TON. It borrows successful elements from other blockchain communities, such as Ethereum‚Äôs EIP and Rust‚Äôs RFC processes, tailoring them to fit TON‚Äôs unique needs and community structure. The document clearly delineates the roles of authors, editors, and reviewers, ensuring a collaborative yet orderly progression of proposals from inception to implementation or rejection.

### [](#questions-and-considerations-2)Questions and Considerations:

1.  **Reviewer Assignment and Qualification**: The process for assigning reviewers to a TEP raises questions about transparency and accountability. How will reviewers be selected, and what criteria will determine their eligibility? Ensuring a diverse and knowledgeable reviewer pool is crucial for the objective assessment of TEPs.
    
2.  **Incentivization and Motivation for Participation**: The document does not address how authors, reviewers, and other participants will be motivated to contribute actively to the TEP process. In open-source and decentralized ecosystems, incentives (whether intrinsic or extrinsic) play a critical role in encouraging sustained and meaningful contributions.
    
3.  **Handling of Rejected Proposals**: While the document outlines the possibility of revising and resubmitting rejected proposals, it does not detail the process for doing so. Clarification on how feedback from the initial review will be incorporated and what steps are necessary for a rejected proposal to be reconsidered could enhance the resubmission process.
    
4.  **Versioning and Deprecation**: The lifecycle states include ‚ÄúActive‚Äù and ‚ÄúReplaced,‚Äù but there‚Äôs a lack of clarity on how versioning of standards and protocols will be managed, especially in cases where backward compatibility is a concern. Additionally, guidelines for deprecating outdated or insecure standards could further strengthen the TEP process.
    
5.  **Community Engagement and Consensus**: The document emphasizes discussions within community channels (e.g., TON Dev chats) prior to formal proposal submission. However, strategies to ensure broad community engagement and consensus-building throughout the TEP lifecycle could be further elaborated.
    

### [](#conclusion-3)Conclusion:

The establishment of a formal TEP process is a significant step forward for the TON community, promising to enhance the blockchain‚Äôs adaptability and innovation. By addressing the aforementioned considerations and continuously refining the process based on community feedback, TON can foster a vibrant ecosystem where collaborative efforts drive forward-thinking standards and improvements. As TON continues to evolve, the TEP lifecycle will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in shaping its future trajectory.

[doge](https://tonresear.ch/u/doge)  February 2, 2024, 1:16pm  1

The evolution of blockchain technology necessitates standardized protocols for address representation to ensure seamless interaction and integration across various platforms. This paper examines the TON Enhancement Proposal (TEP-2), titled ‚ÄúTON Addresses,‚Äù which establishes a comprehensive framework for the representation of addresses within the TON (The Open Network) blockchain ecosystem. This framework is pivotal for developers, users, and wallet applications, facilitating a more intuitive and error-resistant way to handle blockchain addresses.

## [](#introduction-to-ton-address-types-1)Introduction to TON Address Types

TEP-2 delineates several address types within the TON blockchain, including smart-contract addresses, public keys, and ADNL (Abstract Data Network Layer) addresses. Each address type serves distinct purposes, from identifying smart contracts to facilitating secure communications within the TON network.

### [](#smart-contract-addresses-2)Smart-Contract Addresses

Smart-contract addresses in TON are bifurcated into workchain IDs and addresses within those workchains, primarily focusing on the masterchain and basic workchain, which utilize 256-bit addresses. TEP-2 specifies two primary representations for these addresses:

*   **Raw Format**: A straightforward representation featuring the decimal workchain ID followed by a 64-character hexadecimal address.
*   **User-Friendly Format**: A more accessible version that employs a base64 or base64url encoding, incorporating a tag byte, workchain ID, address bytes, and a checksum for error detection.

### [](#public-keys-and-adnl-addresses-4)Public Keys and ADNL Addresses

Public keys, specifically the 256-bit Ed25519 keys, and ADNL addresses, which underpin the TON‚Äôs network protocol, are also standardized under TEP-2. Similar to smart-contract addresses, these entities are represented in both raw and user-friendly (armored) formats, with the latter incorporating a base64(base64url) encoding for public keys and a base32 encoding for ADNL addresses.

## [](#implications-for-wallet-applications-5)Implications for Wallet Applications

TEP-2‚Äôs standardization has direct implications for TON wallet applications, influencing how addresses are displayed and processed for transactions. Key considerations include:

*   **Receiving Addresses**: Wallets are encouraged to display user-friendly, bounceable forms of addresses to enhance usability.
*   **Sending Addresses**: Wallets must validate destination addresses for correctness, network compatibility (mainnet vs. testnet), and bounceable/non-bounceable status, ensuring transactions are executed as intended.

### [](#operational-guidelines-for-wallets-6)Operational Guidelines for Wallets

Operation

Guidelines

Address Validation

Check for valid length, characters, prefix, and checksum.

Network Compatibility Checks

Ensure addresses are compatible with the wallet‚Äôs network (mainnet/testnet).

Bounceable Flag Retrieval

Determine the bounceable status from the address for message sending.

Transaction Execution

Based on the address‚Äôs state (initialized/uninitialized) and bounceable status, appropriately set the `bounce` field of the sending message.

## [](#challenges-and-considerations-7)Challenges and Considerations

While TEP-2 significantly enhances the usability and safety of handling TON addresses, it introduces challenges related to user interface design, particularly the selection difficulty caused by base64 symbols. Additionally, the inability to extract public keys directly from addresses poses limitations for certain on-chain operations.

## [](#conclusion-8)Conclusion

The TEP-2 proposal for TON addresses represents a critical step towards standardizing blockchain address representations, ensuring that users and developers can interact with the TON blockchain more efficiently and securely. By establishing clear guidelines for address formats and their handling by wallet applications, TEP-2 facilitates a more user-friendly and error-resistant blockchain ecosystem. Future enhancements and proposals may further refine these standards to address the evolving needs of the TON community and its technological infrastructure.

The TEP-2 proposal is a foundational document that outlines the structure and representation of addresses within the TON network. It sets a clear and standardized framework for the identification of smart contracts, wallets, public keys, and ADNL addresses, crucial for the secure and efficient operation of the network. This proposal is instrumental in ensuring interoperability and user-friendly interactions within the TON ecosystem.

**Professional Insight:**

The specification distinguishes between smart-contract addresses, public keys, and ADNL addresses, providing a comprehensive approach to addressing within the TON network. The dual representation of addresses ‚Äî ‚ÄúRaw‚Äù and ‚ÄúUser-friendly‚Äù ‚Äî caters to both technical operations and end-user convenience. This duality is crucial for encouraging adoption by making blockchain interactions more accessible to a broader audience. The inclusion of a checksum in the ‚ÄúUser-friendly‚Äù format is a thoughtful addition, enhancing security by reducing the risk of errors in transactions.

**Technical Considerations:**

1.  **Checksum Implementation:**
    
    *   The use of CRC16-CCITT for checksum calculation is a well-established method for error detection, which adds a layer of security by verifying the integrity of the address data. However, it‚Äôs essential to ensure that wallet and dApp developers correctly implement this checksum to prevent any discrepancies in address validation.
2.  **Workchain ID Representation:**
    
    *   The inclusion of workchain ID in the address structure supports the multi-workchain architecture of the TON network, allowing for greater scalability and flexibility. However, it also introduces complexity in address management, necessitating clear documentation and tools to assist users and developers in handling addresses across different workchains.
3.  **Base64 and Base64url Encoding:**
    
    *   The choice of base64 and base64url encoding for the ‚ÄúUser-friendly‚Äù format ensures compatibility across different platforms and applications. Nevertheless, as highlighted in the drawbacks, the presence of characters that are not uniformly handled by operating systems‚Äô text selection mechanisms (e.g., ‚Äò\_‚Äô, ‚Äò-‚Äô, ‚Äò/‚Äô, ‚Äò+‚Äô) could impact usability. Addressing this usability concern requires educating users on the correct methods for copying and sharing TON addresses.

**Professional Questions:**

1.  **Public Key Retrieval:**
    
    *   Given the drawback mentioned regarding the inability to extract public keys from addresses before smart contract deployment, what are the proposed solutions or workarounds for applications requiring pre-deployment communication with smart contracts?
2.  **Address Usability:**
    
    *   Considering the usability challenge with ‚ÄúUser-friendly‚Äù addresses in user interfaces, are there any recommended practices or tools for application developers to improve user experience when interacting with these addresses?
3.  **Multi-Workchain Address Handling:**
    
    *   How does TEP-2 propose to simplify the user and developer experience in managing and interacting with addresses across multiple workchains, especially for those new to the TON ecosystem?
4.  **Future Address Types:**
    
    *   With the current specification covering smart contracts, public keys, and ADNL addresses, is there anticipation for introducing new types of addresses or identifiers in the TON network? If so, how will TEP-2 evolve to accommodate these new types?

In summary, TEP-2 lays a solid foundation for addressing within the TON network, balancing technical requirements with usability considerations. Addressing the identified technical considerations and questions will be critical in ensuring the widespread adoption and seamless operation of the TON ecosystem.

The TON Enhancement Proposal (TEP) 62 introduces a comprehensive standard for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) within the TON blockchain ecosystem. Authored by EmelyanenkoK and Tolya, this active proposal delineates a structured approach to NFT representation, ownership transfer, and collection management, aiming to streamline and standardize NFT interactions across the TON network.

## [](#overview-of-tep-62-1)Overview of TEP-62

TEP-62 outlines a contract interface standard for NFTs, addressing key aspects such as the NFT metadata representation, the mechanism of ownership transfer, and the organizational structure of NFT items within collections. This proposal aims to facilitate interoperability and enhance the user experience by providing a unified framework for NFT creation and management.

### [](#key-components-of-the-nft-standard-2)Key Components of the NFT Standard

The NFT standard proposed in TEP-62 includes several critical components, each tailored to simplify the interaction with and display of unique digital assets:

*   **NFT Items and Collections**: Each NFT item and collection is represented by separate smart contracts, with collections serving as aggregators of individual NFT items.
*   **Metadata Representation**: TEP-62, in conjunction with TEP-64, specifies how metadata associated with NFT items and collections should be structured, supporting both on-chain and off-chain storage options.
*   **Ownership Transfer Mechanism**: The proposal defines a clear process for transferring NFT ownership through internal message handlers, ensuring secure and verifiable transactions within the TON ecosystem.

## [](#comparative-analysis-with-other-nft-standards-3)Comparative Analysis with Other NFT Standards

TEP-62 draws inspiration from existing NFT standards across various blockchain platforms while addressing the unique asynchronous nature of the TON blockchain. Below is a comparative analysis with other notable NFT standards:

**Challenges**:

*   The asynchronous nature of the TON blockchain introduces complexities in the immediate verification of ownership transfers, requiring careful consideration in the implementation of secure transfer mechanisms.
*   Compatibility and integration with existing NFT standards and platforms may require additional bridging solutions to ensure seamless interoperability.

## [](#conclusion-5)Conclusion

TEP-62 represents a significant step towards establishing a robust and unified NFT standard within the TON blockchain ecosystem. By addressing key aspects of NFT representation, ownership transfer, and collection management, this proposal lays the groundwork for a more interoperable, secure, and user-friendly NFT landscape. As the TON ecosystem continues to evolve, the adoption of TEP-62 could pave the way for innovative NFT applications and collaborations across the blockchain space.

The NFT Standard TEP (TON Enhancement Proposal) aims to establish a universal interface for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) within the TON blockchain ecosystem. This proposal seeks to standardize the process of ownership transfer, item collection association, and duplication reduction for the common parts of a collection. It introduces a structured approach for NFT items and collections to interact seamlessly, promoting interoperability and efficiency across different platforms and applications within the TON network.

### [](#professional-insights-1)Professional Insights

The proposal significantly contributes to the TON ecosystem by providing a clear framework for NFT implementation, ensuring consistency and compatibility across various projects. It addresses crucial aspects such as NFT metadata, collection management, and ownership verification, which are vital for the broader adoption and utility of NFTs in the ecosystem. The inclusion of offchain and onchain metadata handling mechanisms offers flexibility for developers, allowing for efficient storage solutions and rich metadata representations.

### [](#questions-and-considerations-2)Questions and Considerations

1.  **Ownership Verification Asynchronicity:** The document mentions the challenge of verifying NFT ownership onchain due to TON‚Äôs asynchronous nature. How do the authors propose to mitigate scenarios where ownership verification is critical for immediate transactions or interactions? Could a standardized temporary locking mechanism or ownership challenge-response protocol be considered to ensure transaction integrity?
    
2.  **Standard Extensions and Future Compatibility:** With the proposal for standard extensions such as NFTRoyalty, NFTBounceable, NFTEditable, and NFTUpgradable, how do the authors envision maintaining backward compatibility and avoiding fragmentation within the ecosystem as new extensions or standards are introduced?
    
3.  **Royalties and Creator Compensation:** The document briefly touches on the complexities of implementing mandatory royalties for sales within the asynchronous TON blockchain. Are there alternative models or proposals being considered that could enable fair compensation for creators while preserving the flexibility and freedom of NFT transfers and sales?
    
4.  **Cross-Chain NFT Interoperability:** As the TON ecosystem grows and interacts with other blockchain platforms, is there consideration for cross-chain NFT standards or protocols that would enable seamless NFT portability and interaction across different networks?
    
5.  **NFT Use Cases Expansion:** Beyond digital art and collectibles, what are the envisioned use cases for NFTs within the TON ecosystem that the standard aims to support? Are there specific industries or applications (e.g., gaming, decentralized identity, real-world asset tokenization) where the authors see significant potential for NFT integration?
    
6.  **Community and Developer Engagement:** How do the authors plan to engage with the TON community and developers to encourage adoption of the NFT standard and gather feedback for continuous improvement? Are there initiatives or platforms in place for collaborative development, standard refinement, and best practices sharing?
    

By addressing these questions, the TON NFT Standard can further solidify its foundation, enhance its applicability across diverse use cases, and foster a vibrant ecosystem for NFT innovation and utilization within the TON blockchain.

## [](#please-describe-your-project-and-token-utility-2)Please describe your project and token utility

NOTNOT is a a memecoin ingeniously crafted to complement the Notcoin venture, residing on the TON blockchain. Proudly asserting their position as early adopters on the TON chain, the Not Notcoin team distinguishes themselves by avoiding the monotonous landscape of founder‚Äôs pet tokens. We are also the number 1 support token of Notcoin and are as a result probably not nothing.

## [](#please-describe-your-project-roadmap-for-the-next-6-12-months-3)Please describe your project roadmap for the next 6-12 months

NotNot aims to complement both Ton and Notcoin ecosystems with its upcoming utilities that include the introduction of the very own NFT‚Äôs called NOTBOTS, an own tapping game, which will likely contribute to bringing more people to TON as it‚Äôs inspired by the very famous game ‚Äúguitar hero‚Äù and you will be able to tap and earn $NOT. NOTNOT also is set to introduce the possibility to stake $NOTNOT in order to earn $NOT. Furthermore $NOTNOT is embarking on a collaborative journey with its community to create an EVM-compatible version of the TON blockchain.

### [](#tevm-rpc-adpater-10)**TEVM RPC Adpater**

The TEVM RPC Adapter acts as a converter for requests between the EVM RPC API and the TVM RPC API, providing an EVM RPC API service that is compliant with standards, appearing externally as a standard EVM RPC node. EVM-compatible wallets (like MetaMask) and Dapps can connect directly through the frontend. It also translates execution results from TVM into EVM-compatible formats.

*   When the TON EVM RPC Adapter receives a transaction request from the user end in EVM format, it wraps the EVM-formatted transaction into TVM‚Äôs transaction format, then sends it to the TEVM entry contract on the TON chain.
*   When the TEVM RPC Adapter receives a contract read request from the user end in EVM format, it converts the read request into a corresponding request for a TVM contract. After reading data from the corresponding storage state of the contract in TVM, it then wraps this data in an EVM format before returning it to the user end.

### [](#tevm-11)**TEVM**

TEVM is essentially a series of smart contracts on TON that implement the full functionality of the EVM.

*   The instruction execution part of TEVM is realized through a series of TON contracts, implementing and optimizing all 140 Ethereum Virtual Machine Opcodes. The corresponding stack is also implemented by these TON contracts. The gas consumption of all Ethereum Virtual Machine Opcodes is consistent with the Ethereum Mainnet, meaning precompiled binary code can be directly deployed on TEVM. At the same time, TEVM provides reserved support for unused opcodes to accommodate potential future upgrades of the EVM.
*   The storage component of TEVM is implemented by a series of TON contracts, which simulate K-V storage through reading and writing these TON values for EVM use. This includes information on different EOA accounts, contract accounts, and the state of the EVM, among other things. Due to TON‚Äôs storage characteristics, dynamically expanding storage is extended in the form of TON subcontracts.
*   Gas consumption on TEVM is paid for with its native token.

# [\[TEP-64\] A Comprehensive Token Data Standard for TON Blockchain](/t/tep-64-a-comprehensive-token-data-standard-for-ton-blockchain/112)

[Application](/c/application/nft/28)  [NFT](/c/application/nft/28) 

[tep](https://tonresear.ch/tag/tep)

    

[doge](https://tonresear.ch/u/doge)  February 2, 2024, 1:23pm  1

The The Open Network (TON) introduces the TON Enhancement Proposal 64 (TEP-64), a pivotal standard defining the interface for token metadata within the TON ecosystem. Authored by EmelyanenkoK and Tolya, this active proposal, created on February 3, 2022, aims to standardize the representation of token data, including Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and Jettons, enhancing interoperability and user interaction across different platforms.

## [](#overview-of-tep-64-1)Overview of TEP-64

TEP-64 outlines a flexible framework for token metadata, accommodating both on-chain and off-chain storage methods. This standard facilitates the automatic retrieval and uniform display of token information by applications such as wallets and marketplaces, streamlining user experience and fostering consistency across the TON blockchain.

### [](#key-features-of-the-token-data-standard-2)Key Features of the Token Data Standard

The proposal delineates several methods for representing token metadata, offering versatility to token creators in terms of data storage and accessibility:

*   **Off-chain Content Layout**: Utilizes a URI to point to a JSON document containing the token metadata, enabling extensive metadata without consuming blockchain storage.
*   **On-chain Content Layout**: Stores all metadata directly within the smart contract, ensuring data immutability and on-chain availability.
*   **Semi-chain Content Layout**: A hybrid approach that stores key metadata on-chain with an additional URI pointing to extended off-chain metadata.

### [](#metadata-attributes-3)Metadata Attributes

TEP-64 specifies a set of attributes for both NFTs and Jettons, covering essential information such as names, descriptions, and images. This structured approach allows applications to consistently display relevant token details to users.

#### [](#nft-and-jetton-metadata-examples-4)NFT and Jetton Metadata Examples

The proposal includes examples of both NFT Collection and NFT Item metadata, illustrating how token data can be structured for effective presentation and use:

*   **NFT Collection Metadata**: Focuses on collection-wide attributes like image, name, description, and marketplace links.
*   **NFT Item Metadata**: Details specific to individual NFTs, including name, description, image, and content URLs.
*   **Jetton Metadata**: Describes jetton-specific attributes such as name, symbol, decimals, and visual representation.

## [](#comparative-analysis-with-other-standards-5)Comparative Analysis with Other Standards

TEP-64 builds upon the foundations set by existing blockchain token standards while addressing the unique needs of the TON ecosystem. Below is a comparative analysis with other notable standards:

*   **Versatility**: TEP-64‚Äôs approach to metadata representation caters to diverse use cases, allowing creators to choose the most suitable method for their tokens.
*   **Interoperability**: By standardizing metadata attributes, TEP-64 enhances the compatibility of TON tokens across different platforms and applications.
*   **User Experience**: The structured metadata format improves the display and understanding of token properties, benefiting both token holders and creators.

### [](#challenges-and-considerations-7)Challenges and Considerations

*   **Data Authenticity**: The off-chain storage method poses challenges in ensuring the immutability and authenticity of token metadata.
*   **Complexity in Semi-chain Layout**: The hybrid approach may introduce complexity in managing and merging on-chain and off-chain metadata.

## [](#conclusion-8)Conclusion

TEP-64 represents a significant advancement in the standardization of token metadata within the TON blockchain. By offering a flexible and comprehensive framework, this proposal not only facilitates the creation and management of tokens but also enhances the end-user experience through consistent and accessible token information. As the TON ecosystem continues to grow, the adoption of TEP-64 could play a crucial role in promoting interoperability, innovation, and user engagement across various blockchain applications.

# Summary

A standard interface for tokens (meta)data (in particular [NFT](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md) or [Jettons](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0074-jettons-standard.md)).

# Motivation

For applications like wallets or marketplaces it is quite useful to be able automatically retrieve information for display. Token data standard allows to simplify this process and uniform the way of token display across different applications.

# Guide

Each token (and also NFT Collection) has its own metadata. It contains some info about token, such as title and associated image. Metadata can be stored offchain (smart contract will contain only a link to json) or onchain (all data will be stored in smart contract).

The TON Token Data Standard TEP-64 offers a structured approach to encoding and accessing metadata for tokens within the TON ecosystem. This standard is vital for facilitating interoperability and consistency across applications that interact with tokens, including NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) and Jettons (fungible tokens on TON). By specifying a uniform method for representing token metadata, either stored directly on-chain or accessible through off-chain links, TEP-64 aims to streamline the integration of token data across wallets, marketplaces, and other token-related applications.

**Professional Insight:**

1.  **Flexibility and Efficiency**: TEP-64‚Äôs allowance for off-chain, on-chain, and semi-chain storage of metadata provides developers with the flexibility to choose the most appropriate and cost-effective method for their use case. This approach can significantly reduce on-chain storage costs while ensuring that essential metadata is readily accessible.
    
2.  **Interoperability**: By defining a standard interface for token metadata, TEP-64 enhances interoperability among different applications within the TON ecosystem. This standardization ensures that tokens can be seamlessly displayed and utilized across various platforms without the need for custom integration work.
    
3.  **Extensibility**: The standard‚Äôs design permits the addition of new metadata fields without risking collisions, providing a future-proof framework that can evolve alongside the ecosystem‚Äôs needs.
    

**Professional Questions:**

1.  **Off-chain Data Authentication**: How does TEP-64 propose to authenticate off-chain data to prevent unauthorized modifications? Ensuring the integrity of off-chain metadata is crucial for applications that rely on this information for rendering token attributes accurately.
    
2.  **Handling Semi-chain Data Collisions**: In cases where there are collisions between off-chain and on-chain data, on-chain values take precedence. How does TEP-64 recommend handling discrepancies that may arise from outdated or conflicting off-chain data?
    
3.  **Standardization of Attributes and Traits**: Does TEP-64 plan to introduce a standardized schema for additional attributes, traits, and non-image content to further enhance consistency across tokens and their representations?
    
4.  **Impact on Data Retrieval Efficiency**: While the flexibility in data storage options is advantageous, has there been consideration given to the potential impact on data retrieval efficiency, especially for applications that may need to access metadata from various storage locations?
    

In summary, TEP-64 plays a critical role in the TON ecosystem by providing a comprehensive framework for token metadata management. Addressing the outlined professional questions and considerations will be paramount in maximizing the benefits of this standard, ensuring secure, efficient, and consistent access to token metadata across the ecosystem.

# [\[TEP-66\] Implementing Royalties in TON's NFT Ecosystem: A Standardized Approach](/t/tep-66-implementing-royalties-in-tons-nft-ecosystem-a-standardized-approach/113)

[Application](/c/application/nft/28)  [NFT](/c/application/nft/28) 

[tep](https://tonresear.ch/tag/tep)

    

[doge](https://tonresear.ch/u/doge)  February 2, 2024, 1:27pm  1

The TON Enhancement Proposal (TEP) 66, also known as the NFTRoyalty Standard Extension, is a pivotal development in the Telegram Open Network (TON) blockchain, providing a standardized method for handling royalty payments for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This extension, active since February 12, 2022, builds upon the foundational [NFT Standard](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md) outlined in TEP-62, offering creators a consistent way to receive royalties from their digital works across various marketplaces within the TON ecosystem.

## [](#overview-of-tep-66-1)Overview of TEP-66

TEP-66 aims to enhance the NFT landscape in TON by introducing a uniform protocol for the calculation and distribution of royalties. Authored by EmelyanenkoK and Tolya, this proposal outlines the necessary contract interfaces and internal messaging protocols required to support royalty payments, ensuring creators are fairly compensated for the ongoing use and sale of their NFTs.

### [](#key-components-of-the-nftroyalty-standard-2)Key Components of the NFTRoyalty Standard

The NFTRoyalty Standard incorporates several critical elements designed to facilitate the easy retrieval and payment of royalties:

*   **Royalty Parameters**: Defined by a `numerator`, `denominator`, and `destination` address, these parameters determine the royalty‚Äôs percentage and the recipient.
*   **Royalty Calculation**: Marketplaces are encouraged to calculate the royalty payment as a percentage of the sale price, using the formula `muldiv(price, numerator, denominator)` to determine the amount sent to the `destination` address.
*   **Implementation Requirements**: NFT collections, or individual NFT items without collections, must implement specific get-methods and internal message handlers to support royalty functionality.

**Advantages**:

*   **Creator Support**: TEP-66 ensures creators continuously benefit from their work, encouraging innovation and participation in the TON NFT ecosystem.
*   **Standardization**: By providing a clear framework for royalties, the proposal facilitates interoperability among different marketplaces and NFT platforms.

**Challenges**:

*   **Enforceability**: As with other blockchain-based royalty standards, enforcing royalty payments relies on marketplace compliance, which cannot be guaranteed.
*   **Fixed Percentage**: While simplifying calculations, a fixed percentage may not suit all types of transactions or agreements between creators and platforms.

## [](#conclusion-5)Conclusion

TEP-66 represents a significant advancement in the TON blockchain‚Äôs NFT framework, offering a standardized approach to royalty management that benefits creators and ensures their contributions are recognized and rewarded. As the TON ecosystem continues to evolve, the adoption of such standards will play a crucial role in fostering a fair, transparent, and thriving digital asset marketplace.

# Summary

Extension for [NFT Standard](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md).

A standardized way to retrieve royalty payment information for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to enable universal support for royalty payments across all NFT marketplaces and ecosystem participants.

# Motivation

It is convenient to standardize royalty, so all NFT markets will pay royalty to collection author independently of how this collection was deployed.

The TEP-66 proposal introduces a significant extension to the NFT standard, focusing on establishing a universal and standardized method for handling royalty payments for NFT creators across various platforms and marketplaces. This move is a critical step towards ensuring creators are fairly compensated for their work and incentivizes the continued production of high-quality digital assets within the TON ecosystem.

**Professional Insight:**

The introduction of a royalty standard is a pivotal development for digital creators, offering them a consistent revenue stream from the secondary market sales of their works. By providing a clear framework for royalty payments, TEP-66 addresses a significant gap in the digital art and collectibles market, potentially increasing the attractiveness of the TON platform for artists and creators. However, the effectiveness of this standard hinges on widespread adoption by marketplaces and compliance with royalty payments, underscoring the importance of community and ecosystem-wide support for the initiative.

**Technical Considerations:**

1.  **Royalty Calculation Method:**
    
    *   The choice to use a percentage-based royalty calculation is pragmatic and adaptable, allowing for flexibility across different sale conditions and currencies. However, it necessitates clear guidelines and potentially standardized tools or libraries to assist marketplaces in accurately calculating and distributing royalties to avoid discrepancies or errors.
2.  **Destination Address for Royalties:**
    
    *   Specifying a destination address for royalty payments simplifies the process for marketplaces to transfer funds. However, this raises questions about the management of these addresses, especially in scenarios where an NFT creator might want to change the destination address for future payments, suggesting the need for a secure and user-friendly method to update this information.
3.  **Marketplace Compliance:**
    
    *   While the standard outlines how royalties should be handled, enforcing this compliance remains a challenge. The reliance on marketplaces to honor royalty payments suggests a need for mechanisms that can enhance transparency and accountability, such as public logs of royalty transactions or integration with smart contract mechanisms that can automate these payments.

**Professional Questions:**

1.  **Enforcement of Royalty Payments:**
    
    *   How does TEP-66 propose to ensure marketplaces comply with royalty payments? Are there mechanisms or incentives in place to encourage adherence to this standard?
2.  **Handling of Multiple Creators:**
    
    *   In cases where an NFT has multiple creators or contributors, how does the standard propose to handle the distribution of royalties? Is there support for splitting royalties among multiple addresses, and if so, how is this configured and managed?
3.  **Updates to Royalty Parameters:**
    
    *   What provisions does TEP-66 offer for updating royalty parameters, such as the percentage or destination address, after an NFT has been minted and sold? How can these updates be made securely to protect against unauthorized changes?
4.  **Cross-Platform Sales and Royalties:**
    
    *   How does TEP-66 address royalty payments for NFTs sold across different platforms or marketplaces? Is there a mechanism to track and enforce royalty payments when an NFT is transferred or sold outside of the original marketplace?

In summary, TEP-66‚Äôs proposal for a standardized royalty system represents a significant advancement for the NFT ecosystem on TON, promoting fairness and sustainability for creators. Addressing the outlined technical considerations and questions will be crucial in ensuring the robustness, fairness, and widespread adoption of this standard across the TON ecosystem.

The TON Enhancement Proposal (TEP) 74 introduces a comprehensive standard for fungible tokens, commonly referred to as Jettons, within the Telegram Open Network (TON). Authored by EmelyanenkoK and Tolya and activated on March 12, 2022, this proposal aims to provide a unified interface for the creation, transfer, and management of fungible tokens, enhancing interoperability and functionality across the TON ecosystem.

## [](#overview-of-the-jetton-standard-1)Overview of the Jetton Standard

The Jetton Standard proposes a detailed framework for the lifecycle of fungible tokens on TON, covering aspects from minting and burning to transfers and wallet interactions. By establishing a set of required contract interfaces and internal message handlers, TEP-74 ensures that Jettons can be seamlessly integrated into wallets, exchanges, and other token-centric applications.

### [](#key-components-of-the-jetton-standard-2)Key Components of the Jetton Standard

The standard delineates the structure and functionality of two primary contract types: the Jetton Master Contract and the Jetton Wallet Contract. Each plays a distinct role in the Jetton ecosystem:

*   **Jetton Master Contract**: Acts as the central authority for a specific Jetton type, managing minting permissions, tracking total supply, and providing Jetton metadata.
*   **Jetton Wallet Contract**: Represents individual holders‚Äô balances, facilitating transfers between wallets and interactions with the Jetton Master.

The TEP-74 proposal introduces a standardized interface for fungible tokens, also known as Jettons, within the TON blockchain ecosystem. This standardization is a significant step towards enhancing interoperability and simplifying the management of tokenized assets on the network. By defining clear protocols for Jetton transfers, ownership queries, and common information retrieval, TEP-74 aims to streamline the creation, distribution, and utilization of digital assets on the TON blockchain.

**Professional Insight:**

The establishment of a fungible token standard within TON, akin to Ethereum‚Äôs ERC-20, provides a foundation for developers to build a wide array of decentralized applications (DApps) and financial instruments. The decentralized nature of jetton-wallet contracts for each owner underpins a scalable architecture that inherently supports TON‚Äôs sharding capabilities, ensuring efficient processing and distribution of the network‚Äôs computational load.

**Technical Considerations:**

1.  **Jetton-Wallet Contract Structure:**
    
    *   The proposal‚Äôs emphasis on individual jetton-wallet contracts for each token owner offers a robust model for asset ownership. This design choice not only facilitates precise tracking of ownership but also optimizes the gas consumption for transactions, making the system economically viable for widespread adoption.
2.  **Transfer and Burn Mechanisms:**
    
    *   The inclusion of `transfer` and `burn` message handlers in the jetton-wallet contract specification is crucial for enabling flexible asset management. These functions allow for the direct and secure transfer of assets between owners and the removal of assets from circulation, which are essential features for managing token economies.

**Professional Questions:**

1.  **Interoperability with Existing and Future Standards:**
    
    *   How does TEP-74 ensure compatibility with existing digital asset standards on TON and plan to accommodate future standards? Specifically, how will this standard interact with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other specialized token types that may emerge?
2.  **Scalability and Sharding Considerations:**
    
    *   Given TON‚Äôs focus on scalability through sharding, what mechanisms are in place within TEP-74 to optimize the distribution of jetton-wallet contracts across shards? How does the standard address potential challenges related to cross-shard transactions and asset tracking?
3.  **Security and Risk Management:**
    
    *   What security measures are recommended or mandated by TEP-74 to protect against common vulnerabilities in token contracts, such as reentrancy attacks or unauthorized access? Additionally, how does the standard propose to manage the risks associated with the `burn` function, ensuring that asset destruction is intentional and irreversible?
4.  **Future Extensions and Functionality:**
    
    *   Are there plans to extend TEP-74 with additional functionalities, such as delegated spending (analogous to ERC-20‚Äôs `approve` and `transferFrom` mechanisms) or advanced tokenomics features (e.g., staking, yield farming)? If so, how will these extensions be introduced to ensure backward compatibility and minimal disruption to existing Jetton implementations?

TEP-74 represents a foundational step towards creating a robust digital asset ecosystem on the TON blockchain. By establishing clear standards for fungible tokens, the proposal not only facilitates the development of diverse DApps and financial services but also contributes to the overall scalability, security, and efficiency of the network. As the TON ecosystem continues to evolve, ongoing refinement and expansion of the Jetton standard will be essential to unlocking the full potential of decentralized finance and asset management on the platform.

Hi, guys! I am glad my prior work on ‚Äúsharded smart contracts architecture‚Äù was useful for TEP-74 as I see link to my presentation in ‚ÄúPrior art‚Äù section: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svOadLWwYaM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svOadLWwYaM) ![:blush:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/blush.png?v=12 ":blush:")

I think this approach is also useful for at least ‚Äúlimit order protocol‚Äù.

Hello, I think **Jetton** may have the following problem with token transfer: For example one user wants to transfer **Jetton** tokens to another user whose owner is another smart contract. The transfer is done in three transactions:

1.  The first transaction is a `tokenTransfer` message that is sent to the sender‚Äôs wallet, where he sends the necessary data such as the recipient‚Äôs address, the number of tokens to be transferred, etc.
2.  The second transaction is sending a `transferInternal` message to the recipient‚Äôs wallet.
3.  The third transaction is sending a `tokenNotification` message to the address of the owner of this wallet (the recipient‚Äôs address).

Actually the problem may be the following: when the contract receives a `tokenNotification` message from the wallet contract and for some reason wants to roll back this transaction (for example, in the code that is responsible for processing the `tokenNotification` message, there are some checks that have not been passed), then he will be able to cancel only the transaction with the `tokenNotification` message (that is the third transaction), but the token transfer itself was in the second.

**BTC Token on the TON Blockchain by Pavel Durov: An Introduction to Innovation**

BTC, a token based on the TON blockchain, represents an interesting phenomenon in the world of cryptocurrencies. Created by the Telegram team, the TON blockchain by Pavel Durov promised fast transactions and high security due to its structure.

This token, although named after the well-known cryptocurrency, is a separate asset created on the TON infrastructure. While the original Bitcoin operates on the Bitcoin blockchain, BTC on the TON blockchain offers an alternative to Telegram‚Äôs own network.

Can BTC on the TON blockchain outperform real Bitcoin? This question remains open. Perhaps, thanks to its features and integration with Telegram, BTC on the TON blockchain will find its user and become preferred in some cryptocurrency use cases. However, real Bitcoin, as the first and most popular cryptocurrency asset, enjoys broad support and recognition, which could be a significant hurdle to potential overtaking.

**General**  
**Tonoreum** is a pioneering project built on the Telegram Open Network (TON), utilizing a unique combination of **Proof of Link and Proof of Work algorithms**. Its innovation lies in creating individual computational power, known as TOR Power, which enables users to mine TOR currency. This project integrates the functionalities of the Telegram app with advanced blockchain technology, marking a breakthrough in integrating communication and distributed ledger technologies. Users, by joining the TOR channel, not only gain TOR Power but also have the opportunity to increase it by referring new users, for which they receive power bonuses. Moreover, referred individuals start with their own TOR Power package and can continue the referral cycle, fostering rapid and organic network growth.

**Tonoreum: A Synergistic Platform for Client-Focused Blockchain Advertising**

Within the innovative framework of Tonoreum lies a transformative advertising platform designed for clients seeking to elevate the visibility of their projects and products. Tonoreum‚Äôs strategic approach integrates advertisement engagement directly into the cryptocurrency mining process, forging a novel pathway for digital marketing.

As a provider, Tonoreum introduces a series of daily tasks for miners‚Äîsimple, swift, yet scalable. By completing these tasks, miners not only extend their mining sessions but also become conduits for promoting our clients‚Äô offerings. This dual-benefit model serves to amplify our clients‚Äô reach while enriching the miners‚Äô experience and potential earnings.

The tasks, engineered to be user-friendly and efficiently integrated into the daily mining routine, will underpin a vast advertising network built upon the Tonoreum protocol. The scale of this network is poised to deliver expansive visibility for our clients, ensuring their projects resonate across a wide and engaged audience.

Participation in Tonoreum‚Äôs advertising network necessitates that clients purchase and subsequently ‚Äòburn‚Äô TOR tokens, thereby activating the marketing services. This requirement not only drives the utility and value of the TOR token but also aligns client investment directly with tangible advertising outcomes.

This innovative fusion of mining and marketing represents Tonoreum‚Äôs commitment to providing a full-spectrum blockchain solution. It not only incentivizes miners through a reward-rich ecosystem but also offers clients a captive audience for their marketing endeavors. Tonoreum‚Äôs model is set to redefine the landscape of blockchain-based advertising, fostering growth and visibility for clients while maintaining an enriching mining environment.

In summary Tonoreum‚Äôs dual-focus platform, highlight both the advertising opportunities for clients and the integrated rewards system for miners.

**Mining**  
Mining in the Tonoreum project is an innovative process that combines elements of traditional cryptocurrency mining with social mechanics and gamification. It utilizes a unique algorithm that allows users to build and increase their computational power, known as TOR Power, through active interaction in the network and the Telegram platform. Every participant in Tonoreum starts with basic computational power, which can be increased in two main ways. The first is through recruiting new users via the referral system. Users receive a unique referral link to share. For each person who joins the Tonoreum project through this link, the referrer‚Äôs computational power increases by 75 units. Newly invited users not only gain a basic computational power of 100 units but also receive an additional bonus of 25 units, encouraging further network expansion. The second key aspect of the mining process in Tonoreum is the ability to earn rewards and increase computational power through special tasks and interactions within the DApp on Telegram.

This application offers users an intuitive graphical panel for managing their computational power, tracking mining statistics, and receiving rewards. Mining in Tonoreum is not limited to the technical aspect. It is a social process that requires building and maintaining an active user network. This approach not only stimulates the growth and development of the Tonoreum ecosystem but also promotes engagement and cooperation among participants. Moreover, through the gamification of the mining process, where users can acquire NFT boosters to increase TOR Power, the project introduces elements of fun and competition, making participation in the network more attractive and engaging.

**TOR POWER**  
In the Tonoreum project, TOR Power represents a unit of computational power that plays a key role in the process of mining rewards from blocks generated every 5 minutes. This mechanism allows users to earn rewards proportional to their share of the total computational power in the network. For example, if there are 10 miners in the network and the total computational power is 1000 TOR Power, a user with 100 TOR Power is entitled to receive 10% of the reward from each generated block. This is a fair and transparent way of distributing rewards, encouraging active participation and increasing computational power.

TOR Power can be increased by referring new users. Each person who joins the project through a referral link not only contributes to the network‚Äôs growth but also increases the referring user‚Äôs computational power by 75 units. New users start with 100 units of TOR Power, and by joining through a referral link, they receive an additional 25 units, giving them 125 units to start with. This structure encourages the building of one‚Äôs referral network and supports both new and existing users in enhancing their computational power.

To maintain activity and engagement in the network, Tonoreum introduced a mechanism for refreshing the mining session. Users must log into their graphical panel every 24 hours and refresh their mining session to maintain their computational power. Failure to log in results in a gradual decrease in computational power according to a specified schedule, leading to a progressive reduction in the ability to mine rewards. This procedure aims to encourage regular interaction with the project and eliminate inactive accounts.

The schedule for the decrease in power in case of failure to refresh the session is as follows:

1.  *   After 24 hours, TOR Power will decrease by 5%.
2.  *   After 48 hours, TOR Power will decrease by an additional 15%.
3.  *   After 72 hours, TOR Power will decrease by another 30%.
4.  *   After 96 hours, TOR Power will decrease by another 45%.
5.  *   After 120 hours, TOR Power will decrease by another 60%.
6.  *   After 144 hours, TOR Power will decrease by another 80%.
7.  *   After 168 hours, TOR Power will decrease by 100%.

Tonoreum plans to introduce additional tasks within the Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism, which will serve not only to renew mining sessions but also as a way to further increase computational power and rewards for active participants. This model ensures that the most active and engaged users are rewarded, fostering the building of a strong and active community around the project.

**BLOCKS & CONTRACT**  
The Tonoreum project has implemented an advanced smart contract, which underpins the mechanism for TOR tokens. This smart contract releases new tokens every 24 hours based on the number of blocks generated during that period. Blocks are mined every 5 minutes, providing regular reward distributions, with each block releasing 364604.563656 $TOR.

An important aspect of the Tonoreum ecosystem is the halving mechanism, occurring every 30 days, which reduces the mining reward for a single block by 15%. This process helps manage inflation and enhances the value of the tokens as the supply of new tokens gradually decreases.

The smart contract is designed to enable the mining of up to 21 billion TOR tokens, establishing a deflationary token economy to increase value over time.

**NFT Collection**  
The Tonoreum project introduces an innovative approach to using NFTs in the blockchain ecosystem, adding to its offering NFT collections that have a direct impact on the dynamics and mining capabilities of users. In the first phase, these unique digital assets will serve as boosters of computational power, TOR Power, offering users multipliers of x2, x4, x6, and x8. Importantly, acquiring these boosters will be possible through the mechanism of burning $TOR tokens, representing an interesting way to regulate the supply of tokens in circulation, while adding value and utility to the process of owning TOR tokens. Additionally, Tonoreum plans to expand the functionality of NFTs in subsequent project phases, introducing collections that will allow direct interactions with other currencies and integration with various blockchain networks.

Such development of the NFT collections will open new opportunities for users related to cross-chain transactions and acquiring various digital assets, increasing interoperability in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The integration of NFTs as boosters of computational power and tools for cross-chain interactions not only distinguishes Tonoreum from other blockchain projects but also introduces a new level of gamification and user engagement. As a result, participants in the Tonoreum ecosystem not only have a direct impact on their mining capabilities and economic potential but can also actively participate in the evolving world of cryptocurrencies, exploring new networks and acquiring a variety of assets. This innovative model introduces an additional layer of involvement and investment in the project, favoring the long-term development and stability of the Tonoreum ecosystem.

The TON Enhancement Proposal 81 (TEP-81) introduces the TON Domain Name System (DNS), a pivotal innovation aimed at transforming human-readable domain names into addresses usable within the TON ecosystem. This active proposal, crafted by EmelyanenkoK and Tolya and introduced on June 25, 2022, delineates the framework for a service that seamlessly translates domain names into TON smart contract addresses, ADNL addresses, and more, thereby enhancing user accessibility and interaction within the network.

## [](#overview-of-the-ton-dns-standard-1)Overview of the TON DNS Standard

TON DNS leverages familiar domain name structures, enabling entities within the TON Network to utilize easily recognizable identifiers instead of complex address formats. This system not only improves the user experience but also fosters a more intuitive interaction with various TON services and applications.

### [](#key-features-of-ton-dns-2)Key Features of TON DNS

*   **Domain Name Format**: Utilizes UTF-8 encoded strings, with a maximum length of 126 bytes, structured in a conventional format separated by dots (e.g., `test.ton`).
*   **Case Insensitivity**: Although technically case-sensitive, domain names are processed in lowercase to ensure consistency and avoid confusion.
*   **Domain Resolution Process**: Employs the `dnsresolve` get-method to translate domain names into relevant addresses or information, with the process beginning at the root DNS smart contract identified through the TON Blockchain configuration.

# Summary

TON DNS is a service for translating human-readable domain names (such as `test.ton` or `mysite.temp.ton`) into TON smart contract addresses, ADNL addresses employed by services running in the TON Network (such as TON Sites), and so on.

# Motivation

While anybody might in principle implement such a service using the TON Blockchain, 
it is useful to have such a predefined service with a wellknown interface, 
to be used by default whenever an application or a service wants to translate human-readable identifiers into addresses.

[satoshi](https://tonresear.ch/u/satoshi) February 3, 2024, 8:55am  2

The TEP-81 proposal introduces a comprehensive standard for the TON DNS system, which aims to simplify the process of mapping human-readable domain names to various TON network addresses. This initiative is crucial for enhancing the usability and accessibility of the TON ecosystem, making it easier for users to interact with smart contracts, services, and other resources without needing to manage or remember complex addresses.

**Professional Insight:**

The TON DNS standard signifies a pivotal advancement towards making blockchain technology more accessible and user-friendly. By adopting a familiar domain name system similar to the internet‚Äôs DNS, TON enables users to easily connect with blockchain resources, thereby lowering the entry barrier for non-technical users. Furthermore, the detailed specification ensures that the system is robust, secure, and capable of supporting a wide range of applications and services.

**Technical Considerations:**

1.  **Human-Readable Domain Names:**
    
    *   The adoption of UTF-8 encoded string domains, with a structured format and restrictions on characters, ensures consistency and prevents confusion. However, the emphasis on lowercase to achieve case-insensitivity might necessitate clear guidelines for dApp developers and users to prevent any inadvertent errors or misunderstandings.
2.  **Security and Privacy:**
    
    *   The proposal‚Äôs approach to resolving domain names, including the use of internal representations and encrypted communication, highlights a commitment to security and privacy. Nonetheless, it would be beneficial to explore further measures to safeguard against potential DNS spoofing or phishing attacks within the TON ecosystem.
3.  **Scalability and Performance:**
    
    *   TON DNS‚Äôs design, which involves root and resolver smart contracts, seems scalable and capable of handling a large number of domain name queries. However, considerations should be made regarding the potential for congestion or delays, especially with the reliance on smart contracts for domain resolution. Optimizations or fallback mechanisms could be necessary to maintain high performance.

**Professional Questions:**

1.  **Domain Name Disputes and Governance:**
    
    *   How does TON DNS propose to handle disputes over domain names, especially in cases of trademark infringement or malicious registrations? Is there a governance model or dispute resolution process in place to address these issues?
2.  **Domain Name Renewal and Ownership Loss:**
    
    *   The proposal mandates annual domain name renewals to prevent permanent loss of domains due to inaccessible wallets. Could there be a mechanism to recover domains if the original owner loses access to their wallet, or is there a risk of losing valuable domain names permanently?
3.  **Support for Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs):**
    
    *   While the proposal currently restricts domain names to ASCII to prevent look-alike domains, is there any consideration for supporting internationalized domain names in the future? This could be crucial for broader adoption of TON DNS across different languages and regions.
4.  **Integration with Existing Internet DNS:**
    
    *   Has there been any consideration for how TON DNS might interoperate or integrate with the existing internet DNS system? Such integration could facilitate smoother transitions between traditional web services and decentralized applications on the TON network.

In summary, the TON DNS standard is a forward-thinking proposal that addresses a key need within the blockchain ecosystem for user-friendly domain names. Its successful implementation could significantly enhance the user experience and foster greater adoption of TON-based applications and services. Moving forward, addressing the outlined questions and considerations will be essential in ensuring the resilience, security, and inclusivity of the TON DNS system.

Great fun meme coin on TON with low market cap and loads of room for growth.

Team has discussed hiring the actor who plays Carlton to make a video for them.

Pythagoras has called it in her channel.

Lots of upside potential.  
Safe team. Safe project.

Dear TON Research Community,

We are thrilled to announce the release of TON Research V1.2. This update brings significant improvements and new features designed to enhance your experience and interaction within our thriving blockchain community.

## [](#current-status-1)Current Status

As the TON blockchain ecosystem continues to grow, so does our community. We‚Äôve reached a new milestone with a record single-day visitor count of 35,000 and an average daily visitor number of 19,000. This incredible engagement drives us to further enhance our platform.

## [](#bug-fixes-and-system-upgrades-2)Bug Fixes and System Upgrades

### [](#updated-email-infrastructure-3)Updated Email Infrastructure

*   **Initial System Limitations and Upgrade:** Originally, our forum system notifications were managed through a personal Gmail account, [\[email¬†protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#13677c7d617660767261707b3d607661657a707653747e727a7f3d707c7e). Due to a significant increase in user activity, this setup became insufficient, leading to its outage on April 1st.
*   **Transition to Enterprise-Level Email:** To enhance reliability and accommodate growing demands, we upgraded to an enterprise-grade Google account, [\[email¬†protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), on April 1st. However, we encountered further capacity issues, resulting in another outage on April 13th.
*   **Deployment of Large-Scale Enterprise Email System:** To ensure continuous service and handle our expanding user base more effectively, we have now implemented a large-scale enterprise email system. As of April 19th, all system communications are being sent from [\[email¬†protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), marking a significant step in our commitment to operational excellence and professionalism.

## [](#others-4)Others

*   **Optimized Twitter Reposting Process:** We‚Äôve refined the automation process for reposting on our Twitter handle [@ton\_research](https://twitter.com/ton_research), making sure our latest updates and discussions are shared timely with the broader community.
    
*   **Optimized Telegram Channel Reposting Process:** Similarly, our Telegram channel [@tonresear\_ch](https://t.me/tonresear_ch) has seen improvements in automation, ensuring seamless updates and engagement with our audience.

[doge](https://tonresear.ch/u/doge)  February 2, 2024, 4:15pm  1

In the evolving landscape of blockchain technology, the introduction of Soul Bound Tokens (SBT) represents a significant milestone in the diversification of digital assets. Unlike traditional Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), SBTs are characterized by their non-transferability, introducing a novel approach to ownership and utility within blockchain ecosystems. This paper delves into the specifications, motivations, and potential implications of the SBT Contract, as outlined in the TEP proposal number 85, with a focus on its role in facilitating new forms of digital identity, ownership, and certification.

### [](#comparative-analysis-1)Comparative Analysis

Feature

SBT Contract

Traditional NFT Standard

**Transferability**

Not transferable; designed to be soul bound to the owner.

Transferable between parties.

**Use Cases**

Certificates, roles/permissions, onchain ownership proofs.

Art, collectibles, gaming items.

**Ownership Proofs**

Supports onchain proofs of ownership with optional revocation by authority.

Ownership proved by possession in wallet.

**Revocation**

Optional revocation mechanism by an authority.

Generally, no revocation mechanism.

**Destruction**

Owners can destroy their SBT at any time.

Dependent on contract specifics.

**Interface Methods**

Implements NFT standard interface with rejection of `transfer` method. Includes unique methods like `prove_ownership`, `request_owner`, `destroy`, and `revoke`.

Standard NFT interface without restrictions on transferability.

### [](#motivation-behind-the-sbt-contract-2)Motivation Behind the SBT Contract

The SBT contract interface is propelled by the need for a blockchain-based mechanism to represent immutable, non-transferable ownership and roles. It addresses the gap in digital ecosystems for tokens that symbolize personal achievements, memberships, or certifications, which should not be transferable to maintain their integrity and the authenticity of their representation.

### [](#implementation-and-technical-specifications-3)Implementation and Technical Specifications

The technical backbone of the SBT contract is built upon the TON blockchain‚Äôs NFT standard interface, with critical modifications to ensure the tokens are soul bound. Key functionalities include:

*   **Prove Ownership**: Enables SBT owners to prove ownership to other contracts, enhancing interaction within the blockchain ecosystem without compromising the non-transferable nature of SBTs.
*   **Request Owner**: Allows querying of SBT ownership details by any party, facilitating verification and validation processes.
*   **Destroy**: Provides the option for an SBT owner to nullify their token, adding a layer of control and flexibility.
*   **Revoke**: An authority-specific function that enables the revocation of an SBT, introducing a dynamic aspect to the otherwise permanent nature of these tokens.

### [](#practical-application-and-guide-4)Practical Application and Guide

The practical utility of SBTs is vast, with applications ranging from academic certifications to membership validations and beyond. The guide outlines procedures for minting, proving ownership, and interacting with contracts in a way that leverages the unique attributes of SBTs, offering a blueprint for integrating soul-bound tokens into various blockchain-based applications.

### [](#rationale-alternatives-and-future-directions-5)Rationale, Alternatives, and Future Directions

The design of the SBT contract is a response to the need for a more nuanced form of digital asset that transcends the limitations of transferability. While other designs, such as ETH‚Äôs EIP-4973, have approached the concept of non-transferable tokens, the SBT contract introduces additional functionalities like onchain proofs and revocation that broaden its application spectrum. The decision against including equip/unequip mechanics, as seen in EIP-4973, stems from a focus on maintaining the integrity of what SBTs represent. Looking ahead, the SBT standard appears to be a comprehensive solution, though its evolution will likely continue in response to emerging use cases and technological advancements.

### [](#conclusion-6)Conclusion

The SBT Contract Interface represents a forward-thinking addition to the blockchain technology space, offering a versatile framework for the creation and management of non-transferable tokens. By enabling the representation of immutable personal achievements and roles on the blockchain, SBTs pave the way for innovative applications that could transform how digital identity and ownership are conceptualized and verified within digital ecosystems.

# Summary

Soul bound token (SBT) is a special kind of NFT which can not be transferred. It includes optional certificate mechanics with revoke by authority and onchain ownership proofs. Holder can destroy his SBT in any time.

# Motivation

There is a useful type of token which allows to give social permissions/roles or certificates to some users. For example, it can be used by marketplaces to give discounts to owners of SBT, or by universities to give attestation certificates in SBT form. Mechanics with ownership proof allows to easily prove to any contract that you are an owner of some SBT.

# Specification

SBT implements [NFT standard interface](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TIPs/issues/62) but `transfer` should always be rejected.

The introduction of the Soul Bound Token (SBT) contract within the TON blockchain ecosystem, as outlined in the TEP 85, heralds a significant leap in the utility and applicability of non-transferable tokens. This comprehensive specification, crafted by a team of notable authors including Oleg Baranov, Narek Abovyan, Kirill Emelyanenko, and Oleg Andreev, aims to infuse the TON network with a type of token that is immutable in ownership yet versatile in its use cases, from social permissions and roles to attestation certificates.

### [](#analytical-insight-1)Analytical Insight

The motivation behind the SBT is clear and well-founded. The need for tokens that can represent non-transferable assets or qualifications in a digital format is increasingly becoming apparent in various blockchain applications. By integrating features such as revocation by authority and onchain ownership proofs, the SBT standard not only ensures the integrity of such tokens but also provides a mechanism for their validation and potential invalidation, thus offering a dynamic layer of interaction not present in traditional NFTs.

### [](#comparative-evaluation-2)Comparative Evaluation

**Feature**

**SBT (TON)**

**ABT (Ethereum EIP-4973)**

Transferability

Non-transferable

Non-transferable

Revocation

Supported, by authority

Not mentioned

Onchain Ownership Proof

Supported

Not explicitly mentioned

Destruction

Holder can destroy

Not specified

Equip/Unequip Mechanics

Not supported

Supported

This comparative analysis illuminates the SBT‚Äôs unique stance within the landscape of blockchain-based, soul-bound tokens. Particularly, its revocation feature and onchain ownership proof extend its utility beyond the Ethereum‚Äôs ABT proposal, potentially paving the way for a wider array of applications within the TON ecosystem.

### [](#professional-inquiry-3)Professional Inquiry

1.  **Extension of Functionality**: Given the static nature of the SBT as proposed, how might future iterations allow for dynamic interactions akin to the equip/unequip mechanics seen in Ethereum‚Äôs ABT, without compromising the soul-bound principle?
    
2.  **Interoperability Concerns**: With the SBT‚Äôs rigid non-transferability and potential for revocation, what measures are in place or proposed to ensure seamless interaction with other tokens and contracts within the TON ecosystem, especially in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications where fluidity of assets is crucial?
    
3.  **Authority Revocation Mechanism**: The specification allows for the revocation of SBTs by an authority. Could you elaborate on the safeguards or protocols established to prevent potential abuse of this power, ensuring that the revocation mechanism is used judiciously and transparently?
    
4.  **SBT Destruction**: The ability for a holder to destroy their SBT introduces interesting dynamics in terms of token lifecycle management. What implications does this have for the permanence of digital certifications or qualifications represented by SBTs, and how might this impact their credibility and long-term value?
    
5.  **Future Developments**: As the standard appears finalized, what considerations are being made towards evolving the SBT specification to accommodate emerging blockchain technologies or novel use cases that may require adjustments to the current framework?
    

The SBT initiative within the TON blockchain is a forward-thinking endeavor that addresses a tangible need for non-transferable tokens with verifiable ownership. As the blockchain space continues to evolve, the development and refinement of standards like the SBT will be critical in harnessing the full potential of blockchain technology for secure, transparent, and versatile digital assets.

The TEP-89 proposal, ‚ÄúDiscoverable Jettons Wallets,‚Äù introduces a significant enhancement to the Jetton standard by incorporating a discoverability feature through the Jetton Master contracts. This extension aims to streamline applications‚Äô ability to detect and interact with specific Jetton wallets, facilitating a more efficient and flexible handling of Jettons across different contracts and applications.

**Professional Insight:**

The introduction of the `provide_wallet_address` message handler as a mandatory component for Jetton Master contracts is a strategic move towards enhancing the interoperability and automation within the TON ecosystem. By enabling contracts to query and receive the wallet addresses associated with specific Jettons directly from the Jetton Master, this proposal simplifies the integration process for applications looking to support a wide range of Jettons without manual configuration or external discovery mechanisms.

**Technical Considerations:**

1.  **Gas Consumption and Fee Handling:**
    
    *   The proposal outlines the minimum TON amount required to process the `provide_wallet_address` request, ensuring that the Jetton Master has sufficient funds to respond. This consideration is crucial for preventing denial of service attacks and ensuring the system‚Äôs sustainability. However, the fixed gas fee might need revisiting as network conditions change to maintain affordability and efficiency.
2.  **Response Mechanism:**
    
    *   The `take_wallet_address` response mechanism, particularly the option to include the original requester‚Äôs address, provides a flexible way for applications to verify and process Jetton wallet addresses. This feature could enhance security by allowing contracts to perform additional validations on the response before proceeding with operations involving the discovered wallet address.

**Professional Questions:**

1.  **Handling Non-Discoverable Jetton Masters:**
    
    *   How does the proposal suggest applications handle Jetton Masters that do not support the new discoverability feature, especially considering backward compatibility with existing Jettons? Is there a recommended fallback mechanism for applications to ensure they can interact with both discoverable and non-discoverable Jettons?
2.  **Security Implications of Discoverability:**
    
    *   Are there any security considerations or potential vulnerabilities introduced by allowing contracts to discover and interact with Jetton wallets directly? For example, could this feature be exploited to track users‚Äô interactions across different applications or manipulate contract behaviors based on the discovered wallet addresses?
3.  **Impact on Contract Design and User Experience:**
    
    *   How does this proposal impact the design of Jetton-related contracts and the overall user experience within the TON ecosystem? Specifically, does the discoverability feature require significant changes to existing contract architectures, and how does it enhance the end-user‚Äôs interaction with Jettons?
4.  **Future Extensions and Enhancements:**
    
    *   What potential extensions or enhancements to the discoverability feature are anticipated in future iterations? For instance, could there be additional query types or response options to provide more detailed information about Jetton wallets or to facilitate more complex interactions between contracts?

Overall, TEP-89 represents a forward-thinking approach to enhancing the flexibility and usability of Jettons within the TON ecosystem. Its successful implementation could significantly streamline how applications and contracts discover and interact with Jetton wallets, fostering a more integrated and user-friendly environment for digital asset management and operations.

I am applying for The Open League Memecoin League on behalf of the jetton memecoin, $UTYA. I am an admin of the UTYA official Telegram, which is a community takeover project.

$UTYA is a token launched on 11 April 2024 as a fair launch as can be verified by on-chain analysis. The community takeover was formed a few days later after a rogue mod deleted the original telegram and the original developer offered to hand over the project to the community. The team is a selection of community members from around the world.

UTYA is based on the popular Telegram sticker pack ‚ÄúUTYA the duck‚Äù. This duck sticker pack is extremely popular amongst Telegram users and has also gone viral in 2024 on other platforms such as X and Twitch. A full history can be found on this [knowyourmeme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/telegram-duck-gifs) page.

It‚Äôs unfortunate that projects like $UTYA seem to replicate existing concepts without acknowledging or respecting the original creators. It raises questions about ownership rights and the ethical implications of such actions. Cloning a project like $duck, which predates $UTYA and has been verified by the DYOR team, undermines the efforts of the original creators.

[satoshi](https://tonresear.ch/u/satoshi) February 3, 2024, 8:53am  2

The TEP-115 proposal for TON Connect introduces a holistic approach to standardizing the communication between wallets and decentralized applications (dApps) on The Open Network (TON). It aims to foster a seamless interaction framework that benefits users and developers by providing a consistent, familiar, and user-friendly experience across the TON ecosystem.

**Professional Insight:**

TON Connect represents a pivotal advancement in the TON ecosystem, addressing a crucial need for standardized wallet-dApp communication. By proposing a unified protocol, TON Connect seeks to eliminate fragmentation and complexity that can hinder adoption and user experience. The decision to leverage Server-Sent Events (SSE) over WebSockets for maintaining a stable and reliable connection exemplifies a thoughtful approach to overcoming common technical challenges in real-time web communication.

**Technical Considerations:**

1.  **Unified Communication Protocol:**
    
    *   The proposal‚Äôs emphasis on a single protocol to support interactions across all types of wallets and dApps is commendable. This approach simplifies the development process, enabling developers to focus on creating innovative features rather than dealing with compatibility issues.
2.  **Security and Privacy:**
    
    *   The use of end-to-end encryption for messages passing through the bridge ensures that user privacy is maintained. This is crucial in building trust in the TON ecosystem, especially given the sensitive nature of transactions and user data involved in blockchain applications.
3.  **Decentralization and Flexibility:**
    
    *   Allowing wallets to host their own bridges and enabling dApps to operate without running a backend server aligns with the decentralized ethos of blockchain technology. This flexibility ensures that TON Connect can accommodate a wide range of use cases and deployment scenarios.

**Professional Questions:**

1.  **Handling Non-Compliant or Legacy Systems:**
    
    *   How does TON Connect propose to integrate or transition existing wallets and dApps that may not initially comply with the new standard? Is there a recommended pathway for these entities to adopt TON Connect without disrupting their current operations?
2.  **Scalability and Performance:**
    
    *   Considering the potential growth in the number of transactions and interactions within the TON ecosystem, how does TON Connect plan to ensure scalability and maintain performance? Are there mechanisms in place to handle high traffic volumes and prevent bottlenecks, especially concerning bridge servers?
3.  **User Experience and Wallet Discovery:**
    
    *   The proposal mentions a centralized list for wallet discovery to enhance developer convenience and user experience. How will TON Connect manage this list to prevent centralization issues and ensure fair representation of all compliant wallets?
4.  **Future RPC Methods and Extensibility:**
    
    *   What considerations are being made regarding the future addition of RPC methods to cover broader functionalities within TON Connect? How will the protocol ensure that new features can be integrated smoothly without causing fragmentation or compatibility issues?

In summary, TON Connect represents a significant step forward in creating a more integrated and user-friendly TON ecosystem. Its focus on standardization, security, and decentralization lays a solid foundation for future innovation and growth. The protocol‚Äôs success will depend on widespread adoption by wallet and dApp developers, as well as its ability to evolve in response to emerging needs and challenges within the blockchain space.

## [](#project-name-1)Project name:

Not Meme

## [](#description-2)Description

Not Meme, $MEM is not just another meme cryptocurrency, but an entire social network for those who love to create, view, and share memes.

Launched on the TON blockchain, Not Meme is dedicated to the culture of memes on Telegram and aims to leverage the popularity of meme-coins to become a leader in this genre.

Not Meme emphasizes its detachment from commercialization and maintains the simplicity and purity of the meme-coin concept. This makes Not Meme a special choice for cryptocurrency enthusiasts who value humor and creativity.

## [](#roadmap-3)Roadmap

1.  The first phase includes listing on CoinMarketCap, promoting Not Meme on Telegram and Twitter trends, and listing on decentralized exchanges (DEX), which enhances its visibility and appeal.
    
2.  The second phase covers listing on centralized exchanges (CEX), launching a Telegram Mini App, and a social network on the website and apps for iOS and Android, where users can create, view, and share memes. A quality meme library will also be launched. The goal is to become a leading resource in the world of memes both on Telegram and in iOS and Android apps.
    
3.  The third phase involves listing on top-tier exchanges and implementing an initiative the team calls ‚Äúmeme-capture.‚Äù The creation of MemeAi, an AI-based tool for automatic meme generation, is planned, promising to bring novelty and dynamism to the meme sphere.

## [](#during-the-first-day-not-meme-managed-to-do-13)During the first day Not Meme managed to do:

*   Listing on [DeDust](https://dedust.io/swap/TON/MEM) and [StonFi](https://app.ston.fi/swap?chartVisible=false&chartInterval=1w&ft=TON&tt=MEM)
*   Over 10M$ Mcap ATH
*   Over 3k holders ATH
*   Over 20M$ Sum Volume
*   Over 5M$ LP ATH

Token type: Meme-token on the TON blockchain.

Total amount: 5,000,000,000 $MEM

**Pre-sale and distribution:** Token distribution started after the pre-sale, with 50% of the $MEM supply allocated to liquidity pools of decentralized exchanges (DEX), and the other 50% distributed among pre-sale participants.

**Liquidity lock:** Liquidity for the LP $MEM token is locked for two years, underscoring the commitment to the project‚Äôs long-term viability and market trust.

**Non-inflationary:** Rights to issue additional $MEM tokens have been revoked, eliminating the possibility of devaluing the currency.

By submitting the form I confirm that the data I provided is correct and I fully understand that in case of the contrary, my project will be permanently eliminated from The Open League.

# [Efficient Wallet Management in MyTonCtrl: A Guide to Importing Wallets](/t/efficient-wallet-management-in-mytonctrl-a-guide-to-importing-wallets/121)

[TON Blockchain](/c/ton-blockchain/build-node/21)  [TON Node](/c/ton-blockchain/build-node/21) 

    

[Johnnie](https://tonresear.ch/u/Johnnie)  February 3, 2024, 5:16am  1

In the dynamic realm of The Open Network (TON), managing and interacting with wallet-like contracts is a critical aspect for users and developers. MyTonCtrl, a versatile tool within this ecosystem, supports a variety of wallet contracts, such as wallet-v1, wallet-v3, and lockup-wallet, among others. This guide delves into the streamlined process for importing wallets into MyTonCtrl using private keys and mnemonic phrases, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## [](#importing-wallets-overview-1)Importing Wallets: Overview

MyTonCtrl offers a user-friendly interface for engaging with different types of wallet contracts. Whether you‚Äôre dealing with a standard wallet-v1 or a more complex lockup-wallet, MyTonCtrl facilitates straightforward interactions.

### [](#using-a-private-key-2)Using a Private Key

For users with direct access to their wallet‚Äôs private key, importing a wallet into MyTonCtrl is straightforward. The process involves a simple console command:

```
iw <wallet-addr> <wallet-secret-key>
```

In this command, `<wallet-secret-key>` refers to your private key in base64 format, and `<wallet-addr>` is the address of your wallet. This method is direct and efficient, ideal for those who prefer using private keys for wallet management.

### [](#using-a-mnemonic-phrase-3)Using a Mnemonic Phrase

Mnemonic phrases, typically a sequence of 24 words, offer another avenue for importing wallets. This method involves several steps but is equally effective:

1.  **Node.js Installation:** Begin by installing Node.js on your system to run the necessary scripts.
2.  **Cloning and Setting Up `mnemonic2key`:** Clone the `mnemonic2key` repository and install its dependencies:
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ton-blockchain/mnemonic2key.git
    cd mnemonic2key
    npm install
    ```
    
3.  **Generating Keys:** Execute the script with your mnemonic phrase and wallet address. This step produces `wallet.pk` and `wallet.addr` files:
    
    ```
    node index.js word1 word2 ... word24 [address]
    ```
    
4.  **Renaming and Transferring Files:** Rename the generated files to `imported_wallet.pk` and `imported_wallet.addr`. Then, move them to the `~/.local/share/mytoncore/wallets/` directory.
5.  **Verifying Wallet Importation:** Access the MyTonCtrl console and use the `wl` command to list the wallets. This step confirms the successful importation and displays the wallet‚Äôs balance.
6.  **Sending Funds:** With the wallet imported, you can initiate transactions using the `mg` command. For assistance, entering `mg` provides helpful documentation.

This method, though slightly more involved, is highly beneficial for those who prefer the mnemonic phrase for wallet recovery or setup.

## [](#conclusion-4)Conclusion

MyTonCtrl stands as a robust tool for TON users, facilitating efficient wallet management through both private keys and mnemonic phrases. Whether you opt for the direct approach of using a private key or the mnemonic method for enhanced security, MyTonCtrl ensures your wallet contracts are easily imported and ready for use. As you navigate TON‚Äôs ecosystem, remember to replace placeholders with your specific details to ensure successful wallet management.

It‚Äôs just a game! A game full of social experiments with highly-trustless Reward Mechanism powered by ZK.

$VIRUS will be minted and sent to top-rated users of each pandemic.

$VIRUS will be deeply integrated and used in the game logic.

## [](#please-describe-your-project-roadmap-for-the-next-6-12-months-3)Please describe your project roadmap for the next 6-12 months

@epidemy will be the second ZK project on TON that will use the result of R&D of the other well-known hated ZK protocol on TONüåö

ZK will be used as a verification layer for the game logic so for the first time on TON we have verifiable game logic implemented.

Will we fail to build a true Web3 competitive game? Only time can tell, but I‚Äôm already tired of waiting for someone to do it so I decided to do it myself.

# [Comprehensive Guide to Becoming a Validator in The Open Network with Mytonctrl on Ubuntu](/t/comprehensive-guide-to-becoming-a-validator-in-the-open-network-with-mytonctrl-on-ubuntu/122)

[TON Blockchain](/c/ton-blockchain/build-node/21)  [TON Node](/c/ton-blockchain/build-node/21) 

    

[Johnnie](https://tonresear.ch/u/Johnnie)  February 3, 2024, 5:18am  1

The evolution of blockchain technology has introduced a myriad of opportunities for network participants. Among these, becoming a validator stands out as a pivotal role, contributing to the network‚Äôs security and consensus mechanisms. This paper presents a detailed walkthrough for aspiring validators within The Open Network (TON), specifically utilizing the mytonctrl tool (version 0.2) on the Ubuntu operating system. Mytonctrl facilitates the management of nodes and wallets, making it an indispensable tool for validators.

## [](#installation-process-1)Installation Process

The journey to becoming a validator begins with the installation of mytonctrl. The process involves downloading and executing an installation script, prioritizing security by recommending operations under a non-root user account.

### [](#steps-for-installation-2)Steps for Installation:

1.  **Script Download**:
    
    ```
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl/master/scripts/install.sh
    ```
    
    This command fetches the installation script from the official repository.
    
2.  **Execute Installation Script**:
    
    ```
    sudo bash install.sh -m full
    ```
    
    Running the script with administrative privileges initiates a comprehensive setup.
    

## [](#operability-verification-3)Operability Verification

Post-installation, validators must ensure the system‚Äôs functionality through a series of checks, notably verifying the operational status of mytoncore and the local validator node.

### [](#key-status-indicators-4)Key Status Indicators:

*   **Mytoncore Status**: Indicated by a green status, signifying operational readiness.
*   **Local Validator Status**: Also denoted by a green status, confirming the validator‚Äôs active state.
*   **Synchronization Metrics**: Initial large numbers that decrease as synchronization advances, with values below 20 indicating full synchronization.

## [](#wallet-management-5)Wallet Management

An integral part of the validator setup is the management of wallets, including the creation of a default wallet during the installation process. Validators must fund this wallet to participate in the consensus process.

### [](#wallet-activation-6)Wallet Activation:

*   **Funding**: Determining the minimum stake requirement from sources such as **tonmon.xyz** and transferring the necessary coins to the validator wallet.
*   **Activation Commands**: Utilizing commands like `vas` for transfer history and `aw` for activation.

## [](#validator-participation-7)Validator Participation

With a funded and activated wallet, the validator node is prepared for participation in TON‚Äôs consensus mechanism. Mytonctrl automates election entry, allowing validators to specify stake amounts and monitor their operational status through commands and logs.

### [](#setting-stakes-and-monitoring-8)Setting Stakes and Monitoring:

*   **Stake Configuration**: Adjusting the stake size with commands such as `set stake 50000` to define the participation level in election rounds.
*   **Log Inspection**: Accessing logs via specified paths to review operational details and troubleshoot as necessary.

## [](#comparative-overview-9)Comparative Overview

By following the steps outlined for mytonctrl on Ubuntu, participants can streamline their entry into this vital role. Through careful installation, operability testing, wallet management, and participation strategies, validators can contribute to a more secure and robust blockchain ecosystem, all while navigating the process with increased ease and support.

# [Empowering TON Validators: A Comprehensive Guide to Nominator Pool Mode Implementation](/t/empowering-ton-validators-a-comprehensive-guide-to-nominator-pool-mode-implementation/123)

[TON Blockchain](/c/ton-blockchain/build-node/21)  [TON Node](/c/ton-blockchain/build-node/21) 

[nominator](https://tonresear.ch/tag/nominator)

    

[Johnnie](https://tonresear.ch/u/Johnnie)  February 3, 2024, 5:23am  1

The decentralization of blockchain networks relies heavily on the contributions of validators to ensure integrity and stability. In The Open Network (TON), validators play a pivotal role, with the Nominator Pool Mode offering a unique avenue for enhanced participation and network support. This guide provides a detailed walkthrough on setting up and running a validator node in Nominator Pool Mode, specifically tailored for validators aiming to optimize their contributions to the TON ecosystem.

## [](#hardware-requirements-and-setup-1)Hardware Requirements and Setup

The foundation of a robust validator node begins with proper hardware setup:

*   **CPU:** 8 vCPUs
*   **Memory:** 64GB
*   **Storage:** 1TB SSD
*   **Connectivity:** 1Gb/s internet speed with a fixed IP address

Distributing nodes across various geographical locations is recommended to prevent network congestion and enhance stability. Providers like Amazon AWS, DigitalOcean, Linode, and Alibaba Cloud are preferred due to their reliability and global infrastructure.

## [](#installation-and-configuration-2)Installation and Configuration

The journey to becoming a validator in Nominator Pool Mode involves several key steps:

1.  **Installing mytonctrl:** Begin by downloading and installing **mytonctrl**. Detailed instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl/blob/master/docs/en/manual-ubuntu.md), covering the initial setup phases.
    
2.  **Wallet Activation:** With mytonctrl installed, activate your validator wallet using the `aw` command after transferring 1 TON to the wallet address listed in the `wl` command output.
    
3.  **Creating Nominator Pools:** Establish two nominator pools to accommodate both even and odd validation rounds, ensuring to set appropriate parameters for validator‚Äôs reward share, maximum number of nominators, and minimum stakes for validators and nominators.
    
    ```
    new_pool p1 0 1 1000 300000
    new_pool p2 0 1 1001 300000
    ```
    
4.  **Activating Pools:** Activate each pool by sending 1 TON to their respective addresses and using the `activate_pool` command.
    
5.  **Deposits and Verification:** Make validator deposits to each pool and invite nominators to contribute. Verification of pool configurations can be done through links provided by `pools_list` command.
    
6.  **Pool Mode Activation:** Finalize the setup by activating pool mode with the `set usePool true` command, allowing for automated participation in validation rounds.
    

## [](#command-tutorials-3)Command Tutorials

Throughout the guide, specific commands are provided to facilitate the setup and management of the validator node and nominator pools. These include:

*   **Wallet and Pool Activation:** `aw`, `activate_pool`
*   **Pool Creation and Management:** `new_pool`, `pools_list`, `deposit_to_pool`
*   **Mode Configuration:** `set usePool true`, `set stake null`

These commands are integral to the successful setup and operation of a validator node in Nominator Pool Mode.

## [](#best-practices-for-validators-4)Best Practices for Validators

To maximize efficiency and network contribution, validators are encouraged to:

*   Maintain hardware specifications at or above the recommended levels.
*   Diversify node distribution to avoid geographical concentration.
*   Engage actively with the community to invite nominators and support network growth.

## [](#conclusion-5)Conclusion

The implementation of Nominator Pool Mode represents a significant advancement in TON‚Äôs validator ecosystem, offering a scalable and inclusive framework for network participation. By following this guide, validators can effectively set up their nodes, contribute to network stability, and foster a more decentralized blockchain environment.

By far the best project on the Ton Network, and the most useful I‚Äôve seen so far on any network. I use Crypton utilities daily - from trending to sniping to scanning to new contracts deployed - they are essential tools.

From an investor perspective - the revenue share is very attractive and the most solid chart I‚Äôve seen in a long time (check the daily). This is my favourite project and my #1 long-term hold.

Congratulations Team Crypton!!!

At Friday 19 April, I book Crypton Trending 12h for my project. **[@CryptonTrendingBot](https://t.me/CryptonTrendingBot)**  
First I send 40 Ton but click View Tx too fast, It‚Äôs not accept and said Fail, because my Transaction is pending. The bot says, it will refund. After that my wallet -40 Ton trending is not active and Refund still don‚Äôt come back to my wallet.

Then, I book second time right after that, send another 40 Ton to book and it success.

I were waiting for refund for my first book, But it‚Äôs now Still don‚Äôt received anything from Cryton trending bot.

I find many way to contact for support but don‚Äôt see any channel to solve this issue, until now I am here.  
Please support me to get my refund.

My 2 Tx here: Please refund 1 tx (40 TON) to me. Thanks

The GEMSTON tokens are funded to staker‚Äôs wallet in the form of fungible tokens on TON  
Blockchain and can be freely transferred, traded, or held at staker‚Äôs discretion.  
The number of GEMSTON that are rewarded is calculated according to the following equation:  
ùëå = ùëã \* ùëöùëñùëõ(ùë°, ùëá) / ùëá  
where ùëã is the amount of staked STON, ùë° is lock-up duration in seconds, ùëá is number of  
seconds in the 2-year period and ùëå is the amount of funded GEMSTON. So, the longer the  
lock-up period, the more rewards and voting power are provided.  
The supply of GEMSTON tokens is theoretically unlimited and [STON.fi](http://STON.fi) DAO is motivated to  
introduce various mechanics that permanently remove GEMSTON tokens from circulation and  
increase demand for these tokens.

# [Deciphering the Dynamics of Sharding in the TON Blockchain: A Comparative Analysis](/t/deciphering-the-dynamics-of-sharding-in-the-ton-blockchain-a-comparative-analysis/125)

[TON Blockchain](/c/ton-blockchain/17) 

    

[Johnnie](https://tonresear.ch/u/Johnnie)  February 3, 2024, 5:30am  1

The TON (The Open Network) blockchain introduces a groundbreaking approach to scalability and transaction processing through its sharding mechanism. This mechanism is pivotal for enhancing the blockchain‚Äôs ability to process a multitude of transactions simultaneously, ensuring both efficiency and speed. This article delves into the intricacies of sharding within the TON blockchain, elucidating the process and its implications for blockchain performance.

### [](#overview-of-sharding-in-ton-1)Overview of Sharding in TON

Sharding in TON is predicated on the division of the blockchain into smaller, manageable segments, known as shards, allowing for asynchronous transaction processing. This division is fundamentally based on the principle that certain transactions can be processed concurrently without interference, thereby optimizing the network‚Äôs throughput.

### [](#sharding-structure-2)Sharding Structure

The sharding structure in TON is uniquely identified by shard IDs, which are 64-bit integers representing a binary prefix of the accounts contained within a shard. This structure enables the blockchain to segment transactions based on the account addresses involved, facilitating asynchronous processing.

#### [](#initial-sharding-configuration-3)Initial Sharding Configuration

Workchain

Initial Shard ID

Binary Representation of Shard ID

Description

Basechain (`0`)

`0x8000000000000000`

`1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`

Contains all accounts with no specific prefix.

Masterchain (`-1`)

N/A

N/A

Always contains one shard, overseeing the entire network.

### [](#sharding-operations-splitting-and-merging-4)Sharding Operations: Splitting and Merging

Sharding operations in TON involve two main processes: splitting and merging. These operations are essential for adapting the network‚Äôs capacity to the fluctuating load of transactions.

#### [](#splitting-process-5)Splitting Process

Shards undergo a split when the transaction volume within a shard increases, dividing into two new shards with IDs that extend the binary prefix of the parent shard. This process ensures that each new shard is responsible for a distinct subset of accounts, maintaining the network‚Äôs efficiency.

Event

Resulting Shard IDs

Account Prefix

Description

Split

`<parent prefix>01000...`, `<parent prefix>11000...`

`<parent prefix>0`, `<parent prefix>1`

New shards take on sequential operations from the parent shard.

#### [](#merging-process-6)Merging Process

Conversely, when the transaction load decreases, shards can merge back into a single shard. This process requires the merging shards to have a common parent, streamlining the network by reducing the number of operational shards.

Condition

Resulting Shard ID

Description

Merge

`<parent prefix>10...`

Two shards with a common parent prefix merge into a single shard, continuing sequential operations.

### [](#practical-example-of-sharding-dynamics-7)Practical Example of Sharding Dynamics

A practical examination of sharding dynamics reveals the fluid nature of shard operations within the TON blockchain. For instance, the transition from a single shard to multiple shards and potentially back, depending on the network‚Äôs transaction load, showcases the blockchain‚Äôs adaptability.

#### [](#splitting-example-8)Splitting Example

*   Initial State: One shard (`0x8000000000000000`).
*   After Split: Two shards, each responsible for accounts with specific binary prefixes.

#### [](#merging-example-9)Merging Example

*   Initial State: Two shards with common parent prefixes.
*   After Merge: A single shard, resulting from the merging of the two shards.

### [](#conclusion-10)Conclusion

Sharding in the TON blockchain represents a significant leap forward in blockchain scalability and efficiency. By dynamically adjusting the number of shards in response to the network‚Äôs needs, TON ensures optimal transaction processing speeds and network performance. This comparative analysis underscores the importance of sharding as a core component of TON‚Äôs infrastructure, highlighting its potential to revolutionize blockchain technology.

# [Optimizing TON's Blockchain Efficiency: An Analysis of Canonical Cell Serialization](/t/optimizing-tons-blockchain-efficiency-an-analysis-of-canonical-cell-serialization/126)

[General](/c/general/4) 

    

[Johnnie](https://tonresear.ch/u/Johnnie)  February 3, 2024, 5:37am  1

The The Open Network (TON) blockchain introduces a sophisticated mechanism for storing and processing data through a structure known as the ‚Äútree of cells.‚Äù A critical aspect of this system is the Canonical Cell Serialization (CCS), which employs a specialized algorithm for weight reordering to optimize the storage and retrieval of data. This article delves into the nuances of cell weight and the weight reorder algorithm, elucidating their roles in enhancing TON‚Äôs blockchain efficiency.

### [](#cell-weight-the-foundation-of-ccs-1)Cell Weight: The Foundation of CCS

In TON‚Äôs CCS, every cell within the tree structure is assigned a weight, which serves as a measure of its ‚Äúheaviness‚Äù or importance. The calculation of cell weight is pivotal for maintaining a balanced tree, ensuring efficient data management. The weight assignment follows specific rules:

*   **Leaf Nodes**: Cells without children are considered leaf nodes, with a weight of 1.
*   **Ordinary Cells**: The weight of a non-leaf cell is the sum of the weights of its child cells plus 1.
*   **Special Cells**: Cells deemed ‚Äòspecial‚Äô are assigned a weight of zero, indicating their unique status within the tree.

The process of assigning these weights is critical for the subsequent steps of the weight reorder algorithm, ensuring that the tree remains balanced and that data can be efficiently accessed and manipulated.

### [](#weight-reorder-algorithm-enhancing-efficiency-2)Weight Reorder Algorithm: Enhancing Efficiency

The weight reorder algorithm is a cornerstone of CCS, tasked with optimizing the tree‚Äôs structure based on the weights of the cells. This algorithm involves several key steps:

1.  **Initial Weight Assignment**: Weights are set for each cell, considering the sum of child weights plus one for non-leaf cells. Special cells receive a weight of zero.
    
2.  **Rebalancing References**: For each root cell, the algorithm assesses whether its references (children) distribute the parent‚Äôs weight evenly. If not, weights are adjusted to ensure a uniform distribution among siblings.
    
3.  **Adjusting Root Weights**: The algorithm ensures that the sum of a root cell‚Äôs references‚Äô weights does not exceed the maximum possible weight. It adjusts the root‚Äôs weight accordingly, either by reducing it to match the sum of its references‚Äô weights or recognizing it as a special cell with zero weight.
    
4.  **Reindexing and Recalculating Hashes**: After rebalancing, the tree is reindexed to prioritize special nodes and their descendants. This step also involves recalculating internal and top hashes counts to reflect the updated structure.
    

The following table summarizes the differences between leaf, ordinary, and special cells in the context of CCS:

Cell Type

Role in CCS

Leaf

Weight = 1

Serve as the basic unit of data storage

Ordinary

Weight = Sum of child weights + 1

Facilitate the hierarchical organization of data

Special

Weight = 0

Optimized for specific use cases within the tree

### [](#conclusion-3)Conclusion

TON‚Äôs Canonical Cell Serialization presents a refined approach to data storage and management in blockchain technology. By intricately balancing the weights of cells within a tree and optimizing the structure through a sophisticated reorder algorithm, TON enhances the efficiency of data processing and retrieval. This mechanism not only underscores TON‚Äôs innovative blockchain design but also showcases the potential for advanced data structures to improve blockchain scalability and performance.

# [5 Secrets of TonCoin üíé That VCs Would Rather Keep Hidden](/t/5-secrets-of-toncoin-that-vcs-would-rather-keep-hidden/1263)

[General](/c/general/4) 

    

[fardint](https://tonresear.ch/u/fardint)  March 24, 2024, 9:13pm  1

In this article, we‚Äôll uncover the secrets of Ton Coin that people tend to keep quiet about because they can potentially make you wealthy and ultimately happier.

Ton Coin, developed by the Telegram team, enjoyed a significant advantage from the start. Telegram raised a staggering $2 billion to build and maintain the Open Network, also known as TON or Ton Coin. This gave them a competitive edge over other cryptocurrencies right from the beginning.

The Telegram team‚Äôs reputation precedes them, known for their dedication and success with their messenger app. Leveraging their expertise and hard work, the Ton Community saw substantial financial gains in 2023.

This is just one of the many secrets in the crypto world that isn‚Äôt widely discussed. As your friend and fellow developer, I‚Äôll share detailed research about Ton Coin here:

## [](#h-1-the-ton-coin-is-community-friendly-cryptocurrency-1)1) The Ton Coin is community friendly cryptocurrency

In the vast landscape of cryptocurrencies and blockchain platforms, choosing the right one for development is crucial. As a developer, I wholeheartedly recommend the Ton Coin. What sets Ton Coin apart is its unparalleled support for developers. Join their Telegram group, and you‚Äôll experience firsthand their dedication to providing accurate and timely answers to any questions you may have about their plans. This level of support is unmatched by similar coins. Working with Ton Coin feels like collaborating with friends and seasoned professionals, ensuring your project finds its best home in the world‚Äôs premier cryptocurrency. Effective communication with developers is key to fostering growth within the network and ecosystem.

## [](#h-2-ton-coin-technology-2)2) Ton Coin technology

The Ton Coin technology comprises a diverse array of services, and in this article, I‚Äôll delve into some of its key offerings:

*   Ton Smart Contracts: Ton Coin adopts FunC as its default programming language, developed by the Telegram/Ton team. While FunC can be challenging to learn, Ton Coin offers Tact, a language similar to Solidity, to facilitate developers‚Äô progress and simplify the development process.
*   [Ton DNS](https://dns.ton.org/): Ton Domain Name Service (Ton DNS) provides a memorable alternative to traditional Ton addresses. For instance, when transferring 1 Ton to your friend Fardin, simply use ‚Äòfardin.ton‚Äô as his address. It‚Äôs that simple!
*   [TON Proxy](https://docs.ton.org/participate/web3/sites-and-proxy): TON Proxy is a proxy technology that facilitates access to information stored on the Ton blockchain. While it‚Äôs a bit complex to explain fully, it‚Äôs important to note that TON Proxy functions differently from a traditional VPN.
*   Ton Sites: This technology enables developers to host their websites on the decentralized version of the World Wide Web (WWW). These websites can be accessed through Ton DNS and Ton Proxy, offering a decentralized browsing experience.
*   Ton Browser: Although currently under development, the Ton Browser is poised to revolutionize decentralized browsing. In the future, users will access decentralized websites directly, eliminating the need for Ton Proxy. These websites can be reached through Ton DNS, such as ‚Äúfardin.ton‚Äù.
*   Ton Space: A prominent feature within the Ton ecosystem, Ton Space enables decentralized interaction with dApps and Web3 projects. Ton fully supports this feature, fostering decentralized engagement within its ecosystem.
*   Jettons: Jettons are smart contracts developed by projects within the Ton ecosystem, functioning similarly to ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum network. Essentially, a Jetton serves as a token within the Ton ecosystem.

## [](#h-3-notably-transactions-on-the-ton-network-are-low-cost-and-often-free-3)3) Notably, transactions on the Ton network are low-cost and often free!

At present, sending a transaction on the Ton Coin blockchain incurs a low cost, often just a few cents. Furthermore, their team has slated gasless transactions for 2024 in their roadmap!

Comparing this minimal fee to Ethereum‚Äôs hefty $100 transaction fee for a swap is enlightening. Now, let‚Äôs uncover the third secret: VCs aren‚Äôt fond of Ton Coin because it undermines their revenue stream, expecting users to pay higher fees on ETH transactions.

## [](#h-4-a-clean-roadmap-is-the-only-way-to-predict-ton-coin-price-in-future-4)4) A clean Roadmap is the only way to predict Ton Coin price In future

The details of Ton‚Äôs 2024 developments haven‚Äôt been officially published by their team, but we‚Äôre ahead of the curve with exclusive insights. Here‚Äôs a sneak peek at the keywords leading to groundbreaking developments:

*   Stablecoin Toolkit
*   Jetton Bridge
*   Collator and Validator Separation
*   Sharding Guidelines and Tools
*   Slashing Optimization
*   Elector and Config Update
*   Extra-currencies
*   ETH-BNB-BTC Bridge
*   Fisherman
*   Voting for Staking Pools
*   Voting UI for Wallets
*   Gasless Transactions
*   Wallet 5.0
*   Multisig 2.0
*   TON Teleport
*   TON Smart Contract Interfaces
*   User-friendly TL-B
*   TON Browser

Among them, the bridge, browser, and stablecoin toolkit are pivotal, potentially driving price surges. Stay ahead of the curve by following our news category for exclusive updates before anyone else.

## [](#h-5-partners-and-exchanges-5)5) Partners and exchanges

Ton Coin has yet to realize its full potential, with a vast list of exchanges, partners, and investors poised for potential partnerships. Prominent names like Binance and Coinbase are among them. However, it‚Äôs worth considering that they may hesitate to partner with Ton, perhaps due to reluctance or concerns about ceding market share to TON.

# [Advanced Mechanisms of Extra Currency Minting in TON Blockchain](/t/advanced-mechanisms-of-extra-currency-minting-in-ton-blockchain/127)

[General](/c/general/4) 

    

[Johnnie](https://tonresear.ch/u/Johnnie)  February 3, 2024, 5:39am  1

The TON (The Open Network) Blockchain introduces a sophisticated framework for the creation and management of extracurrencies, extending beyond its native cryptocurrency, Toncoin. This paper delves into the mechanisms of extra currency minting within the TON ecosystem, as outlined in the TON Blockchain Whitepaper and through its configuration parameters. We explore the low-level and high-level minting flows, highlighting the operational nuances and potential challenges encountered in the minting process.

## [](#overview-of-extracurrency-in-ton-blockchain-1)Overview of Extracurrency in TON Blockchain

TON Blockchain facilitates the definition of arbitrary cryptocurrencies or tokens, identifiable by 32-bit `currency_ids`. These extracurrencies are incorporated into the blockchain‚Äôs configuration and interact seamlessly within the ecosystem. The framework for managing these currencies is embedded within the blockchain‚Äôs masterchain, with specific configuration parameters (`ConfigParam 6`, `ConfigParam 7`, and `ConfigParam 2`) governing the minting process and the Minter‚Äôs operational dynamics.

### [](#configuration-parameters-and-minting-process-2)Configuration Parameters and Minting Process

The minting mechanism is governed by several configuration parameters:

Config Parameter

Description

`ConfigParam 7`

Stores the `ExtraCurrencyCollection`, detailing the currencies to be minted.

`ConfigParam 6`

Defines the minting fees: `mint_new_price` for creating new currencies and `mint_add_price` for minting additional tokens.

`ConfigParam 2`

Specifies the address of the Minter responsible for minting operations.

### [](#minting-flow-analysis-3)Minting Flow Analysis

The minting process operates on two levels: low-level and high-level flows. At the low level, a collator assesses the global balance of all currencies and generates a minting message if the `ConfigParam7` indicates a higher balance requirement for any currency. This message, however, contains only extracurrencies and no Toncoins, potentially leading to an aborted transaction due to insufficient gas.

The high-level flow introduces a more complex sequence, where the Minter smart contract validates minting requests, checks for authorization, and interacts with the configuration contract to update the `ExtraCurrencyCollection`. A notable workaround involves sending a message to a guaranteed bounce address (`0:0000...0000`) to defer the processing of minting requests, a mechanism that, while effective, presents its own set of challenges.

### [](#challenges-and-considerations-4)Challenges and Considerations

The implementation of extracurrency minting in TON raises several issues that necessitate resolution:

*   **Processing Workaround**: The use of a bounce message for deferred request processing is unconventional and may introduce operational inefficiencies.
*   **Minting Failures**: The framework must robustly handle scenarios where minting fails, ensuring clarity and predictability for currency owners.
*   **Burning Mechanisms**: The current structure lacks a straightforward method for burning extracurrencies, a feature that could enhance currency management flexibility.
*   **Minting Fees**: The economic implications of minting fees and the potential for blockchain bloat due to an unbounded number of extracurrencies warrant careful consideration.

## [](#conclusion-5)Conclusion

The TON Blockchain‚Äôs approach to extracurrency minting reflects its commitment to innovation and scalability. However, the intricacies of its implementation, from the use of specialized configuration parameters to the operational challenges encountered, underscore the need for ongoing refinement. As TON continues to evolve, addressing these challenges will be crucial in realizing its full potential as a versatile and dynamic blockchain ecosystem.

### [](#introduction-1)Introduction

Archive Nodes play a pivotal role in blockchain ecosystems, particularly for applications that necessitate access to comprehensive historical data. This guide provides a detailed walkthrough on setting up and operating an Archive Node on the TON Blockchain, designed for developers and operators of blockchain explorers or services requiring extensive historical records.

### [](#system-requirements-and-prerequisites-2)System Requirements and Prerequisites

Before initiating the setup process, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

*   **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 22.04, or Debian 11.
    
*   **User Privileges**: A non-root user with sudo privileges.

```
wget --user <usr> --password <pwd> -c https://archival-dump.ton.org/dumps/latest.zfs.lz | pv | plzip -d -n <cores> | zfs recv data/ton-work
```

Replace `<usr>` and `<pwd>` with your credentials, and adjust `<cores>` to match your CPU‚Äôs capabilities for optimal extraction speed.

#### [](#h-4-configure-and-start-the-archive-node-7)4\. Configure and Start the Archive Node

After restoring the dump, ensure correct permissions are set for the `/var/ton-work` directory. Update the node configuration to specify storage settings for the Archive Node. Start the node with the following command:

```
systemctl start validator.service
```

Monitor the node‚Äôs synchronization process using MyTonCtrl‚Äôs `status` command.

### [](#node-maintenance-8)Node Maintenance

Regular maintenance is crucial for optimal Archive Node performance. This includes stopping the validator service, cleaning old logs, removing temporary files, and restarting the service. Commands for each step are detailed in the main guide.

### [](#troubleshooting-and-backups-9)Troubleshooting and Backups

In case of operational issues, you may roll back to a previous state using ZFS snapshots. Regularly snapshotting your filesystem is recommended for easy rollback and data integrity.

### [](#support-and-community-10)Support and Community

For additional support and questions, join the [TON dev chat](https://t.me/tondev_eng) on Telegram.

### [](#conclusion-11)Conclusion

Running an Archive Node on the TON Blockchain is a straightforward process with the right preparation and resources. This guide provides the necessary steps and best practices to ensure your node is set up correctly and maintained for optimal performance.

> Airdrop snapshot: March 26, 8.00 am CET  
> Airdrop execution: March 28, from 12.00 pm CET

### [](#eligibility-criteria-1)Eligibility criteria

The snapshot captures all wallets that performed swaps on Dedust and/or [Ston.fi](http://Ston.fi) between March 4 (12pm CET) and March 26 (8.00 CET) using pairs with TON or stable coins and tokens participating in [The Open League](https://ton.org/en/open-league) . Sybil wallet addresses were disqualified.

The two eligibility criteria, which were set using the rough median value as the minimum threshold, are as follows:

*   Number of swaps > 10
*   Total trading volume > $2000

With the aim of determining the size of the airdrop for each beneficiary, a points system was created. Based on the volume and number of swaps, each wallet was assigned points. The sum of the points was the final score. Final scores were then grouped into ranges and the size of rewards for each range of scores was determined.

Upcoming plans on TON

1.  Learn - Capsule Machine Raffle: This gamified learning experience incentivizes users to complete missions both on and off-chain to earn capsule tickets. By continuously engaging in project tasks, users have the chance to access the ‚ÄúGOLDEN capsule‚Äù and win big prizes. This not only encourages learning about various TON projects but also rewards consistent participation.
    
2.  Fun - TON Meme Real-Time Price Prediction Game: Leveraging memes and real-time price prediction adds an element of fun and competition to the platform. Users can engage in predicting meme rankings within short intervals, earning points based on their accuracy. Recognizing the ‚Äúking of meme‚Äù and the most accurate predictors further enhances the enjoyment and community engagement.
    
3.  Grow - Collaboration with Launchpad and DEX: By seamlessly integrating with launchpads and decentralized exchanges (DEX), users can directly apply their learning and engagement to grow their portfolios. After discovering new projects and participating in meme games, users are redirected to launchpads and DEX to purchase tokens, facilitating their transition into the web3 space and enabling them to invest in promising projects.

> Airdrop snapshot: April 23, 08.00 am CEST  
> Airdrop execution: April 25

### [](#eligibility-criteria-1)Eligibility criteria

The snapshot captures all wallets that performed deals on [Getgems](https://getgems.io/), [xRare](https://t.me/xrareclub), and [TON Diamonds](https://ton.diamonds/) **between April 11 (2pm CEST) and April 23 (8am CEST)**. Sales by NFT collection owners, non-wallet addresses and sybil wallet addresses were disqualified.

Whitelisted assets included **all NFT collections on the 3 above-mentioned NFT marketplaces** (not endorsement or investment advice).

To be eligible for the airdrop, the wallet needed to perform **at least 2 NFT deals** during the indicated period.

The metrics taken into account to calculate each eligible wallet score are as follows:

*   Number of NFT collections traded
*   Number of NFT deals performed
*   Total NFT trading volume
*   Purchase percentage (on the scale from 0 to 100, where 0 is assigned to wallets with no NFT purchases and only sales, and 100 is assigned to wallets with no NFT sales and only purchases)
*   Current number of NFT on the balance
*   Current value of NFT on the balance

With the aim of determining the size of the airdrop for each beneficiary, a points system was created. Based on the 6 above-mentioned metrics, each wallet was assigned points. The sum of the points was the final score. Final scores including or above the median (with the exceptions for Total NFT trading volume, Purchase percentage and Current value of NFT on the balance where the minimum required value was below the median) were then grouped into ranges and the size of rewards for each range of scores was determined.

**Abstract**

The TON (Telegram Open Network) project emerges as a pioneering force in the blockchain and network technology landscape, transcending traditional blockchain functionalities to introduce a new generation of internet. This paper examines the unique aspects of TON, including its decentralized network, TON Sites, and TON Proxy, comparing these innovations to current internet and blockchain technologies. Through a comprehensive analysis, we highlight how TON‚Äôs integrated solutions offer a secure, private, and decentralized alternative to the conventional internet and domain name systems.

**1\. Introduction**

The TON project, initiated by the TON Foundation on September 29, 2022, represents a significant leap beyond typical blockchain endeavors, introducing a fully decentralized, secure, and private computer network. This network, akin to TOR and the I2P (Invisible Internet Project), is deeply integrated with the TON blockchain, the native Toncoin cryptocurrency, and various TON services, creating a synergistic ecosystem that propels network technology forward.

**2\. The TON Network: An Overview**

The TON network is distinguished by its decentralized nature, stability, anonymity, and encrypted communication, utilizing both UDP/IP and TCP/IP internet protocols. These attributes ensure that the network remains functional and secure, even as nodes become offline or face attempts to compromise their anonymity. A detailed technical explanation of these protocols can be found in The Open Network‚Äôs white paper, particularly in Chapter 3.

**3\. TON Sites and TON DNS**

TON Sites enable web servers to be launched and made accessible within the TON network, leveraging mandatory encryption and data authenticity verification without the need for traditional certification authorities. This section contrasts the TON approach with the conventional internet‚Äôs reliance on HTTPS and the flaws inherent in the existing certification authority system. Additionally, TON Sites eliminate the need for centralized domain name registries, instead using TON DNS for a fully decentralized domain system.

**4\. TON WWW and TON Proxy**

This section introduces TON WWW as a collection of web pages and services on TON, accessible through TON crypto wallets and web browsers, facilitated by TON Proxy. TON Proxy serves as an entry point to the TON network, compatible with HTTP Proxy for seamless browser integration. This innovative approach allows users to access ‚Äú.ton‚Äù sites directly, bypassing the need for traditional domain name systems and enhancing user privacy and security.

**5\. Comparative Analysis**

**6\. Future Directions: TON Proxy 2.0 and 3.0**

Looking forward, the TON project aims to introduce TON Proxy 2.0 and 3.0, focusing on enhancing privacy through intermediary proxy nodes and decentralized finance mechanisms for intermediary TON Proxies. These updates promise to provide full anonymity within the TON network and incentivize the support of the network through a decentralized Toncoin economy.

**7\. Conclusion**

The TON project‚Äôs innovative approach to network technology, domain name systems, and internet privacy presents a compelling alternative to the current internet infrastructure. By leveraging blockchain technology and decentralized systems, TON aims to address the privacy, security, and centralization issues plaguing the modern internet. As TON continues to evolve, it holds the potential to redefine internet and blockchain technologies, offering a more secure, private, and user-friendly experience.

Hello.  
Many people write that they fall under the drop conditions, but never received their airdrop. The question arises: does it mean that someone was not given a bonus unfairly? Perhaps we don‚Äôt fully understand the point conditions? Will there be a reassignment of points, and sending to those who never got the drop? Or will this issue not be resolved?

For example, I should have also had at least 4 points, but I didn‚Äôt get my airdrop either.

Please, solve this situation with NFT drop

This is not a question of 40/70/90 TON, it is a question of openness and honesty with the community

A very small number of people participate in activities and hunt for drops. The NFT drop was distributed to only 2000 wallets, and it seems to me that only 500 - 1000 wallets did not receive it due to a problem with smart contracts.

We are a community of those ‚Äúdegens‚Äù who are most valuable to the ecosystem. Why should your / Getgems‚Äô mistake push us out of the ecosystem?

It costs nothing for you to review the results and give out rewards for everyone, who has fit all requirements. And for us this is very important

It‚Äôs less about those few TONs. I‚Äôm more saddened by the way of communication, the lack of saying at least - sorry, we fucked up, awards given out, there‚Äôs no way to fix it.

And here is silence - quite a few people got nothing, despite meeting the requirements, and there are cases that someone got all 3 tiers of awards at the same time. On top of that, bragging about ‚Äúsuccessful airdrop‚Äù on social media.

Traditional methods, while effective, often grapple with issues of centralization, security, and efficiency, especially as global data needs escalate. The TON Foundation‚Äôs introduction of TON Storage heralds a significant advancement in decentralized data storage, leveraging the robust capabilities of the TON network. This paper delves into the operational framework, technological foundations, and comparative advantages of TON Storage, situating it as a transformative solution in the realm of data management.

**Introduction:**  
The proliferation of digital data necessitates storage solutions that are secure, reliable, and accessible. Conventional systems, though widely utilized, encounter limitations related to centralization, data integrity, and speed, particularly for global users. TON Storage emerges as a revolutionary approach, utilizing decentralized technology to address these concerns. By operating on the TON network, it promises enhanced security, global accessibility, and efficiency.

**Technological Overview:**

**A. TON Network Integration:**  
TON Storage is intricately woven into the TON network‚Äôs fabric, a decentralized, secure, and private network that supports various applications, including TON Sites, TON DNS, and TON Blockchain. This integration ensures that data storage benefits from the network‚Äôs decentralized and encrypted nature.

**B. Operational Mechanism:**  
At its core, TON Storage employs a torrent-based system, albeit with significant enhancements for compatibility and security within the TON ecosystem. Utilizing the TON Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for node communication and data location, it enables a decentralized and efficient method of data sharing and storage.

**C. Storage and Accessibility:**  
The process involves creating ‚ÄòBags‚Äô of files, akin to torrents, which are then accessible through the network without central servers. This method not only democratizes data storage but also facilitates global distribution and redundancy, ensuring data resilience and accessibility.

Laika initially launched on 27th of December as a response to many rug pulls and scams at the time.  
To try and set a good example, we burned the LP tokens and airdropped a majority of the supply to REDO, Ston and Scale holders.

Laika is not about empty promises, dapps, or revenue sharing.  
The ideas was simple, every chain needs a dog coin, and the Russian chain should have a Russian dog.

We did not raise money, we did not do a presale, and we did not sell any tokens.

I believe that once ‚Äòmemecoins‚Äô start trying to add utility to their tokens too early, it kills their essence and they become normal tokens.  
What is the utility of Doge, Pepe or WIF? Nothing, they‚Äôre fun.

One of our plans in development is creating an NFT collection that will be minted by burning Laika tokens. Currently looking for a developer who is able to help build this.

## [](#token-name-1)Token Name

**$MARS** is the token of the TONPlanets Ecosystem.  
Fully integrated in the gaming process as one of the payment methods.

All liquidity of the $MARS token has been locked until 2030

## [](#please-describe-your-project-and-token-utility-2)Please describe your project and token utility

**TONPlanets Mars** - A browser-based economic simulator with an open world, incorporating several core gaming mechanics **M2E** , **P2E** , was launched in 2022. It represents an entire world with its alternative history, characters, storyline, and unique economic model, complemented by an in-game exchange where resource prices are determined based on supply and demand‚Ä¶

We are creating a game where you can learn spot trading in a safe environment. The genre of an economic simulator implies trading practice, which in a gaming format helps to acquire the basic concepts and principles of trading. The game teaches how to calculate the profitability of a business, taking into account depreciation of assets and production costs. Ultimately, thanks to the Martian environment, someone will be able to overcome their fears or insecurities and eventually become a successful trader.

$MARS Token:  
**Payment Instrument in the Game Panel:**

The token is an integral part of the game mechanics, serving as one of the payment instruments in the game panel.

**Trading on DEX and In-Game Exchange:**

The token is actively traded not only on the Decentralized Exchange (DEX) but also on the in-game exchange. This opens opportunities for players to participate in trading and strengthen their position in the game.

**Reward for Land Staking:**

The token also serves as a reward for land staking, incentivizing players to participate in this process and maintain the stability of the game ecosystem.

**Usage in DAO Voting:**

Additionally, the token is utilized in DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) voting processes, enabling players to have a say in the decision-making and governance of the game‚Äôs ecosystem.

## [](#please-describe-your-project-roadmap-for-the-next-6-12-months-3)Please describe your project roadmap for the next 6-12 months

The gaming potential has only been unleashed by 10% so far. We have a multitude of new production facilities with their unique resource chains ahead of us. In the near future, both produced and rare mineral resources, which are not yet utilized in the game, will be incorporated into the gameplay.

The Martian DEX screener, recognized by many TON blockchain users, continues to evolve. New features and opportunities are on the horizon, expanding its functionality.

The introduction of encrypted messaging within TON transactions presents a significant advancement in blockchain technology, enhancing privacy and security for users. This feature, as detailed in the article, leverages the TON blockchain‚Äôs infrastructure to allow users to send encrypted messages along with Toncoin, Jettons, or NFT transactions. Here are several professional insights and questions regarding this implementation:

### [](#professional-insights-1)Professional Insights:

1.  **End-to-End Encryption**: The use of end-to-end encryption for transactional messages significantly enhances the privacy of communication between parties. It ensures that only the sender and recipient can decrypt and read the message, protecting against potential eavesdropping or data breaches.
    
2.  **Decentralized Messaging**: Integrating messaging functionality directly into the blockchain infrastructure leverages the decentralized nature of blockchain, making the communication resilient to centralized server failures. This approach aligns with blockchain‚Äôs ethos of decentralization and redundancy.
    
3.  **Cost-Effectiveness**: The stated network fee for delivering messages (~0.006 TON) demonstrates the potential for blockchain-based messaging systems to offer cost-effective alternatives to traditional messaging platforms, especially for microtransactions or when sending value alongside messages.
    
4.  **Technical Implementation**: The detailed encryption algorithm, including the use of shared secrets, HMAC-SHA512 for key derivation, and AES-256 CBC for encryption, illustrates a robust approach to secure messaging. This methodology follows well-established cryptographic practices.
    

### [](#professional-questions-2)Professional Questions:

1.  **Interoperability with Exchanges and Payment Services**: The advisory against sending encrypted comments when depositing on exchanges or payment services raises questions about interoperability and user experience. How will the system ensure users are aware of and adhere to this guideline, and are there mechanisms in place to prevent accidental encrypted messages to these services?
    
2.  **Public Key Discovery**: The necessity for the recipient‚Äôs public key (pub\_2) for encryption suggests a requirement for public key discovery mechanisms. How does the TON ecosystem facilitate the discovery and verification of public keys, especially considering privacy concerns and the potential for key spoofing?
    
3.  **Message Length Limitation**: The limitation on message length (len(msg) ‚â§ 960) and the technical constraints on the format (k ‚â§ 16, max string length is 1024) might restrict the utility of this feature for more extensive communication needs. What were the considerations behind these specific limitations, and are there plans to extend these capabilities in the future?
    
4.  **User Experience for Non-Technical Users**: While the technical description is thorough, it implies a level of complexity in utilizing this feature. What measures are being taken to ensure that non-technical users can easily access and use encrypted messaging without needing to understand the underlying cryptographic operations?
    
5.  **Security Considerations**: Given the critical importance of security in encrypted communications, what external audits or security assessments have been conducted on this feature to ensure its resilience against cryptographic attacks and vulnerabilities?
    
6.  **Future Developments**: The article hints at potential future integrations and enhancements. Are there specific plans to expand the messaging feature beyond transactional messages, such as integrating standalone messaging capabilities within the TON wallet ecosystem?

# [Advancements in Decentralized Web Navigation: An Examination of TON DNS and Domain System](/t/advancements-in-decentralized-web-navigation-an-examination-of-ton-dns-and-domain-system/140)

[TON Blockchain](/c/ton-blockchain/ton-dns/12)  [TON DNS](/c/ton-blockchain/ton-dns/12) 

    

[kingsman](https://tonresear.ch/u/kingsman)  February 3, 2024, 7:27am  1

The Open Network (TON) introduces an innovative approach to web navigation with its TON DNS service, which translates human-readable domain names into various network addresses within the TON ecosystem. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the TON DNS system, its underlying standards, available software development kits (SDKs), and the structure of domain name management within the TON blockchain. We further explore the significance of \*.ton domains, their implementation, and the processes involved in managing subdomains, highlighting the decentralized nature and flexibility of TON‚Äôs domain name system.

## [](#ton-dns-a-comprehensive-overview-1)TON DNS: A Comprehensive Overview

TON DNS offers a decentralized solution for resolving domain names into TON Smart Contract Addresses, ADNL Addresses, and other service addresses running on the TON Network. This functionality is crucial for enhancing user experience by allowing easy access to TON Sites and services through memorable domain names instead of cryptographic addresses.

### [](#technical-standards-and-sdk-support-2)Technical Standards and SDK Support

The TON DNS system operates based on a well-defined standard outlined in [TON DNS Standard](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TIPs/issues/81), which specifies the domain name format, resolution process, DNS smart contract interfaces, and DNS record formats. Developers can interact with TON DNS through JavaScript SDKs such as [TonWeb](https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb) and [TonLib](https://ton.org/#/apis/?id=_2-ton-api), which facilitate domain resolution and address retrieval directly within applications.

### [](#domain-structure-and-management-3)Domain Structure and Management

**Component**

**Description**

**First-level Domain**

Restricted to `.ton` suffixes, managed by a root DNS smart contract. The system is open to future expansion through network consensus and contract modifications.

\***.ton Domains**

Implemented as NFTs, allowing for compatibility with NFT services and wallets. Domains are acquired through decentralized auctions, with ownership secured on the blockchain.

**Subdomains**

Managed by domain owners through smart contracts specified in DNS records. This allows for flexible creation and assignment of subdomains within the owner‚Äôs domain.

### [](#decentralized-auctions-and-domain-ownership-4)Decentralized Auctions and Domain Ownership

The primary sale of \*.ton domains occurs via decentralized auctions at [https://dns.ton.org](https://dns.ton.org), ensuring a transparent and fair process for acquiring domain names. This mechanism supports the broader vision of a decentralized web, where domain ownership and management are governed by the community rather than centralized authorities.

### [](#subdomain-flexibility-5)Subdomain Flexibility

Owners of \*.ton domains have the capability to create subdomains by assigning smart contracts responsible for their resolution. This feature exemplifies the decentralized and customizable nature of the TON DNS system, allowing domain owners to extend their domain hierarchy as needed.

## [](#conclusion-6)Conclusion

The TON DNS system represents a significant step forward in the development of a decentralized web. By providing a robust framework for domain name resolution and management within the TON ecosystem, it not only simplifies user access to blockchain-based services but also enhances the security and autonomy of online identities. Through the implementation of \*.ton domains as NFTs and the provision for subdomain creation, TON DNS offers a flexible, secure, and user-friendly approach to web navigation in the blockchain era. This system paves the way for further innovations in decentralized domain name services, potentially influencing the broader landscape of internet technology.

[TON Blockchain](/c/ton-blockchain/ton-proxy/14)  [TON Proxy](/c/ton-blockchain/ton-proxy/14) 

    

[kingsman](https://tonresear.ch/u/kingsman)  February 3, 2024, 7:32am  1

The Open Network (TON) is renowned for its decentralized infrastructure, offering a unique ecosystem of TON Sites that are accessible through various methods. This article delves into the most common techniques to access these sites, providing a detailed comparison to help users choose the most suitable option based on ease of use, security, and reliability.

### [](#access-methods-overview-1)Access Methods Overview

### [](#detailed-analysis-2)Detailed Analysis

#### [](#easy-methods-3)![:smile:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/smile.png?v=12 ":smile:") Easy Methods

*   **Browse through ton.run**
    
    *   **Pros**: Immediate access without any setup.
    *   **Cons**: Relies on a third party, potential for downtime, and poses privacy concerns.
*   **TON Wallet and MyTonWallet Extensions**
    
    *   **Pros**: Direct connection to TON Proxy, enhancing privacy.
    *   **Cons**: Requires browser extension installation, limited to browser usage.

#### [](#advanced-methods-4)![:nerd_face:](https://tonresear.ch/images/emoji/twitter/nerd_face.png?v=12 ":nerd_face:") Advanced Methods

*   **Connect to a Public Proxy**
    
    *   **Pros**: Offers a more secure connection than browsing through ton.run and does not require browser extensions.
    *   **Cons**: Configuration required, which might be challenging for less tech-savvy users.
*   **Using Tonutils-Proxy**
    
    *   **Pros**: Provides the highest level of security and privacy, ensuring a direct and encrypted connection to TON Sites.
    *   **Cons**: Involves a more complex setup process, requiring the download and configuration of additional software.

### [](#conclusion-5)Conclusion

Choosing the right method to access TON Sites depends on a user‚Äôs priorities, technical expertise, and the intended use case. For casual browsing, ton.run offers the quickest but least secure access. Browser extensions such as MyTonWallet and TON Wallet strike a balance between ease of use and privacy. Meanwhile, connecting through a public proxy or using Tonutils-Proxy caters to users prioritizing security and reliability over convenience. As the TON ecosystem continues to evolve, these methods may see enhancements in usability and security, further expanding the accessibility of TON Sites to a broader audience.

# [](#burncoin-the-first-and-only-ton-token-that-actually-burns-we-burn-5-of-every-sell-1)Burncoin ‚Äî The first and only TON token that actually burns. We burn 5% of every sell.

$BURN is not just a memecoin, but a utility token for the future protocol on TON.  
We plan to make not an ordinary jetton, but build a unique project with innovative on-chain mechanics.  
We are the first to add deflationary onchain mechanics to a token on TON; 5% of every sale burns forever.

But that‚Äôs not the only BURN feature‚Ä¶

# [](#roadmap-2)Roadmap

Later, we will allow users to mint NFTs that reflect their current Burn Points balance.Thus, these NFTs will be a kind of Proof-of-Burn certificate.  
In the future, these NFTs will have different privileges depending on their balance.

[![roadmap](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/2X/1/11bba75fc74a76885fe912899e37d07a5f40441d_2_500x500.jpeg)

Our roadmap can be also found on our [site](https://burncoin.org/) and in the [docs](https://docs.burncoin.org/roadmap)

By the beginning of Q3, we plan to release MVP of the prediction market protocol on TON. The mechanics are similar to the prediction game on [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/prediction).

Players will be able to bet on the short-term price changes of different cryptoassets. For this purpose, our on-chain protocol will utilize a [RedStone](https://redstone.finance/) oracle price feed.

The winners‚Äô pool of funds will share the losers‚Äô pool of funds. However, a part of the winners‚Äô pool will go to the revenue of the protocol. We will share a portion of this profit with the holders.

In order to make it attractive, everything will be available in a simple and gamified form via the Telegram Mini App.

# [](#key-metrics-3)Key Metrics

On April 20, we raised **35k TON in 3 minutes** at the presale. It was attended by 450+ people.  
The number of holders more than tripled during the week.

For the presale, we made custom smart contracts that returned funds after reaching a hardcap and allowed participants to claim BURN.

![metrics](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d135ed7288911ecc54e06e998e0fd82397cbd7c5.png)  
as for 27 April 2024

Burners are already earning Burn Points without realizing it.

Later, we will allow users to mint NFTs that reflect their current Burn Points balance. Thus, these NFTs will be a kind of Proof-of-Burn certificate.

In the future, these NFTs will have different privileges depending on their balance.

# [Enhancing Network Communication with ADNL: A Deep Dive into TON's Core Protocol](/t/enhancing-network-communication-with-adnl-a-deep-dive-into-tons-core-protocol/143)

[TON Blockchain](/c/ton-blockchain/17) 

    

[ASURADA](https://tonresear.ch/u/ASURADA)   February 3, 2024, 10:55am  1

## [](#abstract-1)Abstract

The Abstract Datagram Network Layer (ADNL) stands as the backbone of the TON (The Open Network), enabling efficient peer-to-peer communication. This technical document delves into ADNL‚Äôs design, its core components, and security measures, providing a comprehensive understanding for developers and network architects interested in leveraging this protocol.

## [](#introduction-2)Introduction

ADNL facilitates seamless interaction among network peers through a meticulously designed framework that incorporates cryptographic identity verification, efficient data transmission methods, and robust security protocols. This document outlines ADNL‚Äôs operational principles, including peer identity management, cryptographic systems, and the intricacies of its client-server and peer-to-peer (P2P) communication models.

### [](#peer-identity-management-3)Peer Identity Management

In ADNL, each peer is identified by a unique keypair, facilitating secure communications through Diffie-Hellman key exchanges. The identity of a peer is derived from its public key as follows:

Element

Description

address

Generated by SHA-256 hashing of type\_id and public\_key

type\_id

Serialized as little-endian uint32

public\_key

Participant‚Äôs public key

This system ensures that each peer can securely identify and communicate with one another without revealing sensitive information.

### [](#cryptographic-systems-4)Cryptographic Systems

ADNL utilizes a specified cryptosystem for its operations, detailed as below:

type\_id (Hexadecimal)

Cryptosystem

Note

0x4813b4c6

ed25519

For x25519 keypairs, conversion to ed25519 is required

These cryptographic measures are integral to maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the data exchanged over the network.

### [](#client-server-protocol-adnl-over-tcp-5)Client-Server Protocol: ADNL over TCP

ADNL employs a TCP-based handshake mechanism for initiating secure client-server communications. This involves the exchange of abstract addresses, public keys, and encrypted session parameters. The handshake process is detailed in the following table:

Step

Action

Key Agreement

Utilizing x25519 or similar for secret derivation

Session Parameters

Generation and encryption of AES-CTR parameters

Handshake Packet Creation

Assembling and sending encrypted session parameters

### [](#datagram-transmission-6)Datagram Transmission

Following a successful handshake, both parties utilize AES-CTR for secure datagram transmission, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the exchanged data. The structure of a transmitted datagram includes a length prefix, nonce, data buffer, and integrity hash, as outlined below:

Element

Size

Description

length

4 bytes (LE)

Excludes length field itself

nonce

32 bytes

Randomly generated value

buffer

Variable (length-64)

Data payload

hash

32 bytes

SHA-256 hash of nonce and buffer for integrity

This framework ensures data integrity and prevents unauthorized manipulation during transmission.

### [](#security-considerations-7)Security Considerations

ADNL incorporates several security measures to protect against potential vulnerabilities, including:

*   **Handshake Padding**: Though its purpose is not explicitly defined, it is speculated to allow future cryptographic flexibility.
*   **Encryption Key Derivation**: Aids in generating unique session keys, enhancing security.
*   **Datagram Nonce**: Prevents bit-flipping attacks and ensures message integrity.

## [](#conclusion-8)Conclusion

ADNL‚Äôs architecture offers a robust foundation for building secure, efficient, and scalable network applications. By adhering to the principles outlined in this document, developers can leverage ADNL to enhance communication within the TON ecosystem and beyond.

## [](#references-9)References

This document references the original work and contributions of the TON community and developers, providing a foundation for further exploration and development within the ADNL framework.

You! Yes, you sitting there clueless, thinking you‚Äôve got it all figured out. Let me burst your bubble and lay it out straight for you: you‚Äôre missing out big time if you‚Äôre not jumping on the BURN token train on TON Space. And I‚Äôm not here to hold your hand and coddle you, I‚Äôm here to slap some sense into you, so listen up!

First things first, let‚Äôs talk about that burning mechanism. It‚Äôs not just some cute little feature, it‚Äôs a game-changer. Every freaking transaction, 5% of those coins get torched, obliterated, gone. You sell? You burn. You buy? You burn. It‚Äôs as simple and brutal as that. And guess what? We‚Äôve already lit up 10% of the total supply in just a freaking week. That‚Äôs right, while you‚Äôre sitting there twiddling your thumbs, others are making bank.

And then there‚Äôs the Burncoin: Proof of Burn collection. It‚Äôs not just some digital doodad, it‚Äôs a goddamn testament to your commitment. You want that shiny piece of glory? You better be ready to walk through fire to get it. And let me tell you, buddy, the rewards for those who burn are sweet, sweet victory.

Oh, and don‚Äôt even get me started on the Proof of Burn protocol. The team‚Äôs cooking up something that‚Äôs gonna blow your freaking mind. We‚Äôre talking about rewriting the rules, flipping the script, and leaving all the wannabes in the dust. And you? You could be part of that revolution. Or you could sit there, twiddling your thumbs, while the world passes you by.

So yeah, the project might be in its infancy, but mark my words, it‚Äôs a freaking juggernaut in the making. Collaborations, launches, you name it, we‚Äôre on it. And the community? It‚Äôs tighter than a straightjacket. You want to know where this rocket‚Äôs headed? Check the damn roadmap, it‚Äôs right there, plain as day.

So what are you waiting for? Get off your sorry ass, stop making excuses, and get in on the action. Because if you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôre gonna be kicking yourself when you realize what you missed out on. You either burn with us, or you get left in the ashes. The choice is yours, but make it quick, because time waits for no one.

**Embark on a linguistic quest with WordBooX!**

This innovative Learn 2 Earn game leverages TON blockchain technology, offering a fun way to master new languages through engaging gameplay.

Players match word pairs to earn coins, which they can either trade or use to pay for educational courses.

We collaborate with language schools to enhance educational opportunities, fostering a global community that thrives on linguistic and cultural exchanges. Join us to transform how you learn languages and connect with cultures worldwide!

**Milestones 1**

*   Application Development:
*   Planning and Architecture: Define the core functionality, user interactions, and architectural framework of the application.
*   Coding: Develop the application using appropriate programming languages, integrating blockchain technologies as necessary for Web 3.0 features.
*   Testing:
*   Unit Testing: Test individual components for functionality and stability.
*   Integration Testing: Ensure all parts of the application work together seamlessly.
*   User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Validate the completed application against user requirements.
*   Design Adaptation:
*   UI/UX Design: Create and adapt user interfaces and experiences that are intuitive and align with Web 3.0 aesthetics.
*   Responsive Design: Ensure the application is responsive and functional across different devices and platforms.
*   Web 3.0 Implementation:
*   Blockchain Integration: Incorporate blockchain technology for enhanced security and decentralized features.
*   Smart Contracts: Implement smart contracts to automate transactions and interactions within the app.
*   Tokenization: Use tokens for in-app transactions or as part of loyalty programs.

This structured approach ensures a comprehensive development process, integrating Web 3.0 technologies to enhance user engagement and security.

**Milestones 2**

Here are the key papers and documents prepare during the ‚ÄúMarketing and Promotion‚Äù stage of a project:

*   Marketing Strategy Document:
    *   Outlines the overall marketing goals, target audience, and strategies to reach them.
    *   Includes analysis of market trends, competitive landscape, and positioning.
*   Promotion Plan:
    *   Details specific promotional activities planned, such as social media campaigns, email marketing, content marketing, and partnerships.
    *   Schedules and budgets for each promotional activity.
*   Content Calendar:
    *   A schedule that organizes the publication of different types of content (blogs, videos, social media posts) across various platforms.
*   Social Media Strategy:
    *   Outlines how the project will use social media to engage with audiences, including platforms, content types, posting frequency, and engagement tactics.
*   Advertising Plan:
    *   Details on paid advertising strategies, including online ads, print ads, and other media.
    *   Budget allocation and expected ROI for each ad campaign.
*   Public Relations (PR) Plan:
    *   Strategies for gaining media coverage, including press releases, media kits, and PR events.

*   Metrics and Analytics Report Template:
    *   Defines key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness of marketing efforts.
    *   Template for regular reporting on analytics and adjustments to the strategy.

These documents will help guide the promotional efforts, ensuring that they are strategic, coordinated, and effective in reaching the desired audience.

Don‚Äôt be confused by the solana badge. Initially, we worked on the project on this blockchain, but we did not meet a reliable feedback from the solan community, and we plan to transfer the project to TON if we receive sufficient support. Go ahead, build the TON ecosystem together!

# The Open Beta Season has begun!

All participants will receive prizes at the end of the beta season. All player progress will be saved. And you can choose how you want to receive your prizes: in-game or in cryptocurrency. By mastering professions, you can already receive crypto or in-game currency and interact with other players. New updates every week. Always something to keep you interested.

[![commands](https://tonresear.ch/uploads/default/original/2X/b/becf6492e4dbd2dd2da12768a33b6943e8e77093.png)](https://postimg.cc/SX61K247)

# First command

/Startgame - The very first command you will have to start with. It will be used to create your game account so you can start your great adventure as soon as possible! Just type it in the ‚Å†üî•ÔΩústartgameÔΩúüî• channel if you are playing in official server, or in any game channel if your are playing in other servers and follow the prompts, interacting with our game through the buttons.

# Resources

/Collect - One of the basic commands for collecting resources manually in the early stages of the game. Later, when you have established automatic resource farming with the help of buildings in your village, you can continue to use this command to get as many resources as possible, as well as to find valuable items with low drop chance. BUILDINGS /Build - An important command thanks to which you will open the building construction menu to create powerful tools to gather resources, improve your hero and army, places to trade between players and in-game merchants. Just type this command, and interact with the interactive menu in the messages that appear.

/Village - By entering this command you can see your village from a bird‚Äôs-eye view, as well as see a statistic about the resources of your settlement. From the village you can easily move to the town hall or other buildings with the help of convenient navigation buttons.

/Townhall - Takes you to the town hall, where you will see the characteristics of your hero. His attack power, health, defense, and influence on his people. For more information on characteristics, see characteristics.

# Items

/Inventory - with this command, you can open your backpack and see what items you have picked up and are currently carrying. These can be crafted aitimes, equipment, or trinkets, which you can easily sell in the store, or at auction.

# Trade

/sell - With this command, you can sell any item from your inventory or resource to another player. Enter the command and follow the tooltips. Select the category from which you want to transfer the item and click on the item itself. Your customer will be notified about your offer, and he will need to click the buy button

/give - With this command, you can share any item from your inventory with another player. Enter the command and follow the tooltips. Select the category from which you want to transfer the item and click on the item itself. Your friend will be notified that you are sharing it with him, and he will need to click the pick button

# Professions

/mine - First profession available for training. (Remember, you can only choose one profession to train). Go in search of treasures and resources in deep mines. In order to go to the mines, learn the mining profession in /townhall, purchase a pickaxe in /market, equip it, and enter the /mine command to start exploring the Arcanor caves. For each move in the caves, you will need to give 2 pieces of wood to strengthen your mines

/blacksmith - The second profession available for training. (Remember, you can only choose one profession to train) Train this profession in the /townhall and activate it with a /blacksmith command. Collaborate with ore miners, smelting metals, upgrading your items, creating unique tools and armor.

# PVE

/Journey - An integral part of the game is traveling. It is your main way to collect valuable loot as well as experience. Enter this command in the channel of your region and go in search of adventure! In this mode you will fight monsters. But be careful. Encounters with monsters will not be easy. You'll need wits and the proper allocation of resources and abilities to win, and save your strength for future battles. Also, you can go to the dungeon from your town hall, using the command /Townhall. And one day you will be able to find a dungeon (each leveling region has its own unique dungeon) in which you can endlessly dive deeper and deeper, finding more valuable and valuable treasures and reinforcements. But don't expect to get off easy here either. This part of the lvling is especially hadrcore. Good luck!

/Dungeon - As soon as you find a dungeon in your levelling zone, you can go straight to the dungeon and continue where you stopped last time.

# Currency

/dealer - With this command, you can buy ARCA cryptocurrencies, exchange it for in-game crystals, or exchange in-game crystals for gold.

$TGR is the systemic token of the Tegro ecosystem, utilized to stimulate liquidity and transactions on the decentralized exchange, [Tegro.Finance](https://tegro.finance/).

The token offers unique financial opportunities through a well-thought-out economic structure and distribution mechanisms.

Owners of the first version of $TGR can exchange their tokens for the upgraded $TGR V2 on a one-to-one basis, maintaining their value and liquidity.

The $TGR token offers a range of utilities across the Tegro ecosystem, enhancing user engagement and financial dynamics. It is actively involved in various programs:

1.  **Partnership Program**: $TGR tokens play a crucial role in our partnership programs, providing mutual benefits and incentives for collaboration.
2.  **Staking**: [Staking of $TGR](https://tegro.finance/staking) tokens takes place directly on the Tegro.Finance exchange. Lock-up periods range from 30 to 270 days, with longer periods yielding higher interest rates for token holders.
3.  **Liquidity Pools on DEX**: $TGR is an integral part of the [liquidity pools](https://tegro.finance/liquidity) on the decentralized exchange Tegro.Finance. By participating in these pools, users can facilitate trading on the platform and earn a portion of the transaction fees as rewards.
4.  **Earning Opportunities**: Users have multiple ways to earn $TGR, such as by participating in ecosystem activities or by engaging with partner projects.
5.  **Payment Method in Telegram Bot**: The $TGR token is now used as a payment method in the [Telegram bot](https://t.me/smoapp_bot?start=ref_1628878888) for a social media promotion service. Spend cryptocurrency and receive services in return.

Additionally, every transaction made using Tegro Pay now rewards users with $TGR tokens as cashback. This feature not only enhances the value of using Tegro Pay for regular transactions but also encourages the accumulation and utilization of $TGR within the ecosystem. The integration of $TGR into everyday transactions solidifies its role as a cornerstone of the Tegro platform, promoting usage and retention.

### [](#q4-2024-5)Q4, 2024

*   **Integration with Social and Media Platforms**: We are developing integrations that will enable the use of TGR for subscriptions, advertising, and other services on popular platforms. This will open new channels for TGR utilization.
*   **Educational Campaign for TGR**: We‚Äôre organizing webinars and workshops to raise awareness about the benefits of cryptocurrency, specifically focusing on TGR. These educational efforts are designed to inform and attract new users to the ecosystem.

### [](#q1-2025-6)Q1, 2025

*   **Launching TGR on Additional Exchanges**: We‚Äôre working to list TGR on major international crypto exchanges to enhance its accessibility and liquidity.
*   **Enhancing Staking Features**: We are introducing new staking options with variable lock-up periods and increased interest rates, particularly for long-term investors.

This roadmap is tailored to boost the use of TGR and expand its application in various business sectors and industries.
